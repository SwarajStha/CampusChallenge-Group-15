Notes on these core references:

    Ji & Han (2022) provided the empirical persona foundation:

        Experience-based (novice/intermediate/professional)

        Strategy-based (day/swing/position/long-term traders)

        Social media sentiment patterns linked to market movements

    Pedersen et al. (2022) provided the theoretical persona framework:

        Naive investors (persuasion bias, social learning)

        Fanatics (stubborn beliefs, narrative leaders)

        Rational short-term vs long-term investors

        Network effects on price dynamics (bubbles, momentum)

These two papers together gave you the complete 4-persona taxonomy (Novice, Fanatic, Day/Swing, Long-term) with both behavioral realism and theoretical grounding for your weighted sentiment model.
