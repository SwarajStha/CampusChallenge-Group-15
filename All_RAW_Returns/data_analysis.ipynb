         "Is Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR) a Good Buy Right Now?",
         "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Pot Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (NYSE:IIPR) stands against the other pot stocks.\n\nThe history of the cannabis industry is riddled with changes and conflicting legislation. The international media has played an important role in shifting perspectives about marijuana and drug use. Today, we are watching the slow and steady change of mainstream opinion to consider cannabis one of the more harmless – and probably even potentially beneficial – drugs still considered largely illegal. As perspectives change, we can expect the laws to eventually follow suit.\n\nGlobal Cannabis Industry:\n\nAs we mentioned in our article – 20 Cities with the Most Expensive Weed in the World – the global cannabis market was valued at $47.32 billion in 2022, and is projected to grow from $57.18 billion in 2023 to $444.34 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 34% during the forecast period.\n\nMarijuana legalization is gaining momentum around the globe, driven primarily by the increasing recognition that the product may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications. It is the most widely cultivated, trafficked, and consumed drug worldwide.\n\nEasing Federal Restrictions:\n\nIt was announced on the 16th of May that the US Justice Department has officially proposed a new rule that would reclassify marijuana from a ‘Schedule I’ drug, which includes heroin and LSD, to a less tightly regulated ‘Schedule III’ drug, which includes ketamine and some anabolic steroids. The decision marks a major policy shift by the federal government and while it would neither make the substance legal nor decriminalize it on a federal level, it would recognize the medical uses of cannabis and acknowledge that it has less potential for abuse than the many more harmful drugs. The change would also open more doors to conduct research on marijuana.\n\nAnother significant benefit of the reclassification is that it could add fresh arguments for supporters of ballot measures seeking to legalize cannabis in states where it is still illegal. An example of this is Florida, where voters will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing recreational weed this November.\n\nBut perhaps the ones benefiting the most from this change are cannabis companies, which after the rescheduling would no longer have to follow tax provisions under a rule called 280E, which prevents them from taking standard business tax deductions.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling is far from the federal legalization that the cannabis industry is so desperately waiting for, it is a step in the right direction. As a result, several marijuana stocks and pot ETFs posted solid gains following the announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 8 companies operating in the cannabis industry with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAerial view of a large REIT building complex, its facade reflecting the city skyline.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (NYSE:IIPR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 12\n\nNext up on our list of the Best Cannabis Stocks is Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (NYSE:IIPR), a key player in the real estate sector supporting the growth of the legal medical cannabis industry, offering investors exposure to the cannabis market through a real estate-focused investment vehicle. The San Diego-based company has consistently increased its revenue over the last four years, from $116.9 million in 2020 to $309.5 million in 2023. Net income has also more than doubled from $63.87 million to $162.75 million in the same period.\n\nAlan Gold, the executive chairman of Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (NYSE:IIPR), stated in the company’s Q1 earnings call transcript:\n\n“The company notched another solid quarter in Q1, generating $2.21 in AFFO per share and further enhancing the company's liquidity position in the first four months of the year, with the upsizing of the revolving credit facility from $30 million to $50 million. Our total available liquidity exceeded $200 million as of the quarter end and fully funds any remaining development commitments we have, along with providing ample dry powder for additional strategic investments. Additionally, we have one of the lowest levered balance sheets in the REIT industry at 11% debt to total gross assets, no variable-rate debt, no debt maturities until May 2026.”\n\nOn the 14th of June, Innovative Industrial Properties announced a Q2 2024 dividend of $1.90 per share of common stock, representing a 4.4% increase over its Q1 2024 dividend of $1.82 per share and building upon the highly impressive 5-year dividend growth CAGR of +38.9%. IIPR is a great dividend pot stock, as the company has been growing its dividends for the past seven years. The upcoming cannabis federal reclassification is also expected to significantly help IIPR, especially since the company has Trulieve, Curaleaf, and Green Thumb (the three largest US multi-state cannabis operators by market cap) as its core tenants.\n\nThe stock of IIPR was held by 12 hedge funds at the end of Q1 2024 in the IM database, with a collective stake value of $127.8 million.\n\nOverall IIPR ranks 5th on our list of the best pot stocks to buy. You can visit 8 Best Pot Stocks to Buy to see the other pot stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of IIPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IIPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

         "Why Are Analysts Bullish on The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG) Right Now?",
         "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Pot Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) stands against the other pot stocks.\n\nThe history of the cannabis industry is riddled with changes and conflicting legislation. The international media has played an important role in shifting perspectives about marijuana and drug use. Today, we are watching the slow and steady change of mainstream opinion to consider cannabis one of the more harmless – and probably even potentially beneficial – drugs still considered largely illegal. As perspectives change, we can expect the laws to eventually follow suit.\n\nGlobal Cannabis Industry:\n\nAs we mentioned in our article – 20 Cities with the Most Expensive Weed in the World – the global cannabis market was valued at $47.32 billion in 2022, and is projected to grow from $57.18 billion in 2023 to $444.34 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 34% during the forecast period.\n\nMarijuana legalization is gaining momentum around the globe, driven primarily by the increasing recognition that the product may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and therapeutic applications. It is the most widely cultivated, trafficked, and consumed drug worldwide.\n\nEasing Federal Restrictions:\n\nIt was announced on the 16th of May that the US Justice Department has officially proposed a new rule that would reclassify marijuana from a ‘Schedule I’ drug, which includes heroin and LSD, to a less tightly regulated ‘Schedule III’ drug, which includes ketamine and some anabolic steroids. The decision marks a major policy shift by the federal government and while it would neither make the substance legal nor decriminalize it on a federal level, it would recognize the medical uses of cannabis and acknowledge that it has less potential for abuse than the many more harmful drugs. The change would also open more doors to conduct research on marijuana.\n\nAnother significant benefit of the reclassification is that it could add fresh arguments for supporters of ballot measures seeking to legalize cannabis in states where it is still illegal. An example of this is Florida, where voters will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing recreational weed this November.\n\nBut perhaps the ones benefiting the most from this change are cannabis companies, which after the rescheduling would no longer have to follow tax provisions under a rule called 280E, which prevents them from taking standard business tax deductions.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling is far from the federal legalization that the cannabis industry is so desperately waiting for, it is a step in the right direction. As a result, several marijuana stocks and pot ETFs posted solid gains following the announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 8 companies operating in the cannabis industry with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA farmer standing in a lush field of vegetables that has been enhanced by the company's hydroponic products.\n\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 29\n\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) manufactures and sells consumer lawn, garden, and pest control products, as well as soilless indoor gardening equipment. The Ohio-based company has applied its expertise in horticulture and gardening to develop innovative technologies and solutions specifically tailored for cannabis cultivation. SMG reported revenue of over $1.52 billion in Q2 of 2024 ending March 31st, 2024, a slight decrease from the $1.53 billion reported in the same quarter last year. However, net profit soared by an impressive 44%, from $109.4 million to $157.5 million, due to the decrease in costs.\n\nJim Hagedorn, CEO of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) stated in the company’s Q2 earnings call transcript:\n\n“Everything we've done to get to a better place is happening, just like we projected it would when we laid out our fiscal ‘24 guidance. We told you we would achieve high single-digit growth in the consumer business and $575 million in adjusted EBITDA this year. And we'd do so while generating $1 billion in free cash flow over two years by the close of fiscal ‘24, improving gross margin by at least 250 basis points, and finding a long-term solution for Hawthorne. Free cash flow is a fabulous story. It improved over $500 million from prior year, exceeding our first half target by $200 million. Our debt levels are down by more than $750 million year-over-year. The most telling sign we're in a better place is our leverage improvement. For Q2, we finished at 6.95x EBITDA, well within our covenant max of 7.7x, and better than Q1.”\n\nThe Hawthorne Gardening Company, SMG’s struggling subsidiary for cannabis growers, reported 28% lower net sales compared to the year before, mainly driven by lower volumes and price reductions. Hawthorne is moving away from distributed products to cut costs, shutting down 13 of its distribution centers in the last two years, and is now focused on its more profitable, exclusive, and owned brands like Gavita, Botanicare, General Hydroponics, Psycho, Mother Earth, and HydroLogic. The subsidiary’s recently announced distribution partnership with BFG is also expected to lower cost structure throughout the year.\n\n29 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database were bullish on SMG in Q1 of 2024, with a collective stake value of $422.7 million.\n\nOverall SMG ranks 2nd on our list of the best pot stocks to buy. You can visit 8 Best Pot Stocks to Buy to see the other pot stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of SMG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

         "European Markets Rise on Bets Le Pen to Miss Absolute Majority",
         "(Bloomberg) -- The euro strengthened as traders digested signs Marine Le Pen’s far-right party was poised to win the first round of France’s legislative election with a smaller margin than some polls had indicated.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJustice Department to Charge Boeing, Seeks Guilty Plea from Planemaker Biden Asks Donors to Stay Following Disastrous Debate Biden's Defiance Has Democrats Fearing They'll Lose White House Biden Party Allies Close Ranks as Poll Signals Voter Concern Trump as President or Private Citizen: Why Supreme Court’s Immunity Ruling Is a Test\n\nThe common currency climbed 0.3% to $1.0745 in early Asia trading, its strongest since Tuesday. European equity futures also climbed, while French bond contracts edged higher, shrugging off a selloff in global peers.\n\nInitial projections showed Le Pen’s far-right party in front of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front — but with potentially fewer votes than it needs to secure an absolute majority after a second round of voting.\n\nThe market has been concerned that a very strong showing for Le Pen’s National Rally will increase the odds of expansive fiscal policy, bringing the nation’s bloated fiscal accounts sharply into focus and further muddying the outlook for the common currency.\n\nThe focus now turns to whether her party can garner enough support in the second round of voting on July 7 to get an absolute majority in the National Assembly, which would allow it to pass legislation more easily. President Macron and her other opponents are already strategizing to keep the far-right party out of power, with any signs of progress likely to bolster the case for a relief rally.\n\n“We now have a week of horse-trading ahead of us,” said Joachim Klement, head of strategy, accounting and sustainability at Liberum Capital, who expects the euro to strengthen through the week as alliances are formed to reduce the gains of Le Pen’s party.\n\nWhat Bloomberg strategists say...\n\nIf the leftist alliance is “is aimed at blocking Le Pen’s grouping from getting a majority in the crucial second round, it has wide-ranging implications for the France-German spread and indeed the euro. If the upshot is that we will get a more centrist government, it would be positive for the currency and herald a narrower spread.”\n\n— Ven Ram, cross-asset strategist for MLIV\n\nThe National Rally was projected to get between 33% and 34.2% of the vote, according to initial projections from four polling companies on Sunday. Bloomberg’s final poll of polls on Friday put them at 36.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe left-wing alliance was set to get between 28.5% and 29.6% of the vote and Macron’s centrist alliance between 21.5% and 22.4%, projections on Sunday showed.\n\nIf alliances forming to block Le Pen from absolute power start to look credible, French markets would likely recover, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\n“A hung parliament could make it hard to get anything done in France in the current parliament, which is exactly what the markets would like,” she said.\n\nStill, strategists warn there is likely volatility ahead, as the electoral calculus gets complicated in the runoff when parties can strategically withhold candidates in certain constituencies to give a boost to a centrist hopeful.\n\nVolatility Is Only Certainty for Traders Parsing French Results\n\nMacron’s decision to call a snap vote in early June had sent markets into a tailspin.\n\nHis party — which supports large spending cuts to get France’s budget deficit under control — suffered a crushing defeat in European parliamentary elections. National Rally, meanwhile, has touted some costly budget measures including lowering the sales tax on energy and fuel.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year French bonds over safer German debt rocketed to more than 80 basis points, levels last seen during the euro area’s sovereign debt crisis. The euro fell to its lowest since early May.\n\nFiscal Pressures\n\nWhile the 10-year yield spread may find some relief as trading starts on Monday, it’s hard to see a “material and sustainable snap back,” said Peter Goves, head of developed market debt sovereign research at MFS Investment Management.\n\n“Uncertainties are high, French fundamentals haven’t changed and the final outcome is still unknown and unknowable with the large number of three-way contests complicating matters,” he said.\n\nAt a projected 5.3% of output this year, France’s budget deficit already far exceeds the 3% of economic output allowed under European Union rules. The International Monetary Fund predicts without further measures, debt would rise to 112% of economic output in 2024, and increase by about 1.5 percentage points a year over the medium-term.\n\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli.\n\n(Updates market moves.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back The FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for ‘You’ Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

         "Investing.com — Despite the continued outperformance in the tech space, the market saw a broadening of the rally into more areas of the market over the last few weeks. In fact, the advance-decline ratio (also known as the market breadth indicator), which measures the number of positive stocks against the number of negative ones, hit a 15-month high just last week.\n\nBut were you able to bank on that trend, or are you still buying the same stocks that already rallied in the first half of the year?\n\nThose following our state-of-the-art AI-powered stock strategies for less than $7 a month as part of our exclusive summer sale are in that first bucket.\n\nJust to give you an example: While NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - part of both Tech Titans and Beat the S&P 500 strategies for June - kept on gaining, it was far from the top performer in our list, which had stocks such as Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) (+25% in June) and Autodesk Inc (NASDAQ:ADSK) (+22.75% in June) posting much better numbers.\n\nNot only that, more than a handful of stocks from our list outperformed Nvidia in June, showcasing our AI's impressive ability to pick winners otherwise obscure for most retail investors.\n\nThis has helped both our AI's Tech Titans and Beat the S&P 500 strategies beat the benchmark S&P 500 again in June.

         "Coinbase: Solana Outperformed Due to Tech Advancements and ETF Filing\n\nSolana (SOL) has outperformed major cryptocurrencies last week, with its value rising by 9% over the past seven days. In contrast, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen declines of over 4% and 2%, respectively during the same period, according to CoinMarketCap data. Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han attribute Solana's impressive performance to several catalysts specific to its ecosystem, including significant technological advancements and VanEck’s filing for the first spot Solana ETF in the U.S.\n\nThe analysts outlined several recent developments that have bolstered the Solana blockchain. One noteworthy innovation is ZK Compression technology, which could significantly reduce costs on Solana, particularly for large-scale token distributions. This technology promises to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the network, making it more attractive for various applications.\n\nAdditionally, Solana's Blockchain Links, or \"blinks,\" represent another major advancement. This technology allows the embedding of Solana-specific actions into any website user interface, potentially transforming the user experience for Solana applications. This could lead to a more seamless and integrated user experience, driving further adoption of the Solana blockchain.\n\nMoreover, the filing of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) by VanEck has added another layer of optimism around Solana. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, announced on X that the company had filed for the first Solana ETF in the U.S. Following this, 21Shares announced its application with the SEC for a spot Solana ETF. This development, regardless of its eventual outcome, is seen as a promising step that could bring more institutional interest and investment into Solana.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana was trading at around $147.67, gaining 6.5% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nView comments",

         "Boeing given a week to admit fraud charges amid battle to contain safety crisis",
         "An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing jet crash killed 157 people in 2019 - AP Photo/Mulugeta Ayene\n\nBoeing has been given a week to admit fraud charges or face a public trial over two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max planes.\n\nIn a fresh blow to the crisis-hit aerospace giant, the US Department of Justice is said to have given the company until Friday to admit wrongdoing.\n\nThe company would have to pay a $244m (£192m) criminal fine and accept a three-year probation period, CBS and Bloomberg reported.\n\nBut pleading guilty to a criminal charge could also have implications for the company’s work with the US military, it is feared.\n\nIt came as Boeing and Airbus reached terms to divide up Spirit AeroSystems, the fuselage and wing supplier at the centre of its latest safety crisis.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe plea offer was made on Sunday and reopens a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement struck between American prosecutors and the company.\n\nThat previous agreement – which followed fatal crashes involving two 737 Max planes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people – also required Boeing to pay a $244m fine, to submit to monitoring and improve its safety processes.\n\nBut prosecutors have now accused Boeing of violating the deal amid a fresh safety scandal at the company, which was plunged into crisis again in January when one of its 737 Max 9 planes flown by Alaska Airlines suffered a mid-air blowout.\n\nThe incident, where a door plug blew out at 16,000 feet, has since been chalked up to botched paperwork and safety checks at Boeing’s factory near Seattle, prompting the company to pledge a series of changes.\n\nHowever, the fresh plea bargain being offered to Boeing has angered families of people who died in the 737 Max crashes, with lawyers branding it a “sweetheart deal”.\n\nPaul Cassell, an attorney representing the families, told Bloomberg: “The deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing’s crime killed 346 people.\n\n“The families will strenuously object to this plea deal.”\n\nIn an attempt to draw a line under the crisis, Boeing has agreed to pay $4.7bn for Spirit AeroSystems, which made the door plug that blew out of the 737 Max plane in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbus will acquire assets involved predominantly in the production of its own planes for a nominal sum of $1, while receiving $559m in compensation from Spirit.\n\nAmong those parts of Spirit bound for Airbus is the former Short Brothers plant in Northern Ireland responsible for making wings for the A220 jet.\n\nTaking Spirit in house is a key plank of Boeing’s bid to eliminate manufacturing defects and improve quality control as it battles to address the safety crisis around the Max and restore the reputation of its best-selling model.\n\nSpirit was spun off from Boeing in 2005 as part of a cost-cutting drive which many in the industry blame for a loss of oversight over the production process and ultimately for January’s near-tragedy involving the door plug on an Alaska Airlines jet. Passengers narrowly avoided being sucked out of the Alaska Airlines jet when the door blew out mid-flight - NTSB/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBoing boss Dave Calhoun said that the deal was in the best interests of the flying public, his company’s airline customers, employees and “the country more broadly”.\n\nHe said: “By reintegrating Spirit we can fully align our commercial production systems and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcome, centred on safety and quality.”\n\nThe Alaska Airlines incident occurred after Spirit supplied a Max fuselage including a door plug with improperly fitting bolts to Boeing’s 737 factory in Seattle.\n\nBoeing workers detected the issue but failed to raise the required paperwork when the plug was removed for repairs, allowing the plane to continued around the assembly line and ultimately to be delivered to Alaska Air with the plug pushed back in but not secured.\n\nThe 737 remained intact for more than 100 flights before the plug blew out at 16,000 feet after it departed Portland, Oregon, with passengers’ seatbelts saving them from being ripped from the plane.\n\nMax production was initially halted before being restarted at a reduced level on the instructions of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nBoeing sent inspectors to Spirit, alongside officials from the FAA, revealing more manufacturing glitches, and announced that it would launch a takeover of the Wichita, Kansas-based firm in order to take full control of production.\n\nThe acquisition will be an all-stock transaction, Boeing said, and values Spirit at $37.25 per share.\n\nThe deal avoids a feared break-up of Spirit’s Belfast operations, with Airbus taking over both the site’s A220 wing and mid-fuselage production and “non-Airbus work”.\n\nThe European planemaker will acquire Spirit’s business in Prestwick, Scotland, on the same terms, and is also taking over the supplier’s A350 fuselage operations in North Carolina and St. Nazaire, France and A220 work in Morocco and Kansas.\n\nAirbus said the agreement, expected to close next year, will guarantee the continued supply of components for its planes on a more sustainable financial basis.",

         "Reasons to Retain Baxter International (BAX) in Your Portfolio Now",
         "Baxter International BAX is poised for growth, given the demand for its medically essential products, coupled with transformational actions. However, inflationary pressure remains a concern.\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 13.5% year to date against the industry's 2.3% growth. The S&P 500 Index has increased 14.7% in the same time frame.\n\nBAX, with a market capitalization of $17.05 billion, is a global medical technology company providing items such as kidney-dialysis equipment, infusion pumps and intravenous solutions. The company has an earnings yield of 8.7% compared with the industry's (0.9%). It anticipates earnings to improve 6.6% over the next five years.\n\nWhat's Driving the Performance?\n\nBaxter Internationalended first-quarter 2024 with a strong improvement in both earnings and revenues. Sales across all product categories were strong, except for a decline in Care & Connectivity Solutions, led by softness in the U.S. primary care market. However, the category is likely to return to growth in the second half.\n\nFollowing the erratic impact of the pandemic and its recurrent surges over the past few years, demand for Baxter’s products reflected a sustained recovery in demand in 2023. Increasing hospital admissions and rising procedural volume, coupled with higher alternate sites of care, are likely to drive the company’s prospects in 2024. Moreover, capital spending by hospitals is likely to improve in 2024, which should drive demand for related products.\n\nThe transformational actions announced last year that included a new simplified structure to create a more resilient supply chain and greater alignment with the company’s manufacturing footprint are likely to be completed by mid-2024.\n\nAs a part of its restructuring initiatives, Baxter International divested its BioPharma Solutions business to Advent International for $4.25 billion in cash in 2023. The divestment helped the company to offload a business, which is facing declining sales following reduction in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing, and save in interest expense in 2024.\n\nBAX has also progressed with its plan to create a standalone kidney care company that will comprise its Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories. The independent company, expected to be formed following the potential spin-off by July 2024, will be called Vantive.\n\nRevenues from continued operations totaled $3.59 billion in the first quarter, up 2% on a reported basis and 3% at constant currency. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotable Developments\n\nEarlier this month, Baxter International received the FDA’s approval for an expanded indication for Clinolipid (Lipid Injectable Emulsion) to be used in pediatric patients, including preterm and term neonates.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn April, the company announced the expansion of its Pharmaceutical portfolio with the launch of five injectable products in the United States. The launched products are likely to provide ready-to-use formulations that promote patient needs in key therapeutic areas and benefit healthcare professionals with additional convenience. The FDA cleared BAX’s Novum IQ large volume infusion pump with Dose IQ Safety Software for use in the U.S. market. The addition of new software is expected to enable clinicians to utilize a single, integrated system across a variety of patient care settings.\n\nWhat's Weighing on the Stock?\n\nAlthough recovering, the company continues to face pressure for services related to hospital admissions and procedural volumes. Supply-chain disruptions continue to hurt growth, albeit slowly, when compared with the last few quarters. Baxter International has a significant presence in the APAC market, with the geography contributing nearly 17% to its 2023 revenues. Within APAC, China represents a significant opportunity for growth. However, challenging market dynamics in Greater China are likely to put pressure on the company’s top line in the upcoming quarters.\n\nEstimates Trend\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $15.11 billion, indicating a 1.1% gain from the previous year’s level.\n\nThe consensus mark for adjusted EPS is pinned at $2.91, indicating an 11.9% increase from the year-ago reported number. The consensus estimate for adjusted EPS has improved 0.7% in the past 60 days.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, DaVita Inc. DVA and Encompass Health EHC.\n\nHaemonetics, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12%. HAE’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 13.24%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nHaemonetics’ shares have lost 3.3% year to date against the industry’s 2.3% growth.\n\nDaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.6%. DVA’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 29.35%.\n\nDaVita’s shares have risen 32.2% year to date compared with the industry’s 5.1% growth.\n\nEncompass Health, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.6%. EHC’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 18.74%.\n\nEncompass Health’s shares have risen 28.5% year to date compared with the industry’s 5.1% growth.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the last decade-plus, consumers have ‘cut the cord’ to their traditional cable subscriptions in favor of streaming options. While that is a headwind, this affinity to streaming means more households need high-speed internet, and companies that successfully serve customers can enjoy high retention rates and pricing power since the options for internet connectivity in any geography is usually limited.\n\nThe 6 cable and satellite stocks we track reported a weaker Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 1.9% below consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the cable and satellite stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 0.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q1: Cable One (NYSE:CABO)\n\nFounded in 1986, Cable One (NYSE:CABO) provides high-speed internet, cable television, and telephone services, primarily in smaller markets across the United States.\n\nCable One reported revenues of $404.3 million, down 4.2% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 1%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue, earnings and operating margin estimates.\n\n“The first quarter of 2024 was our second straight quarter of sequential residential data customer growth,” said Julie Laulis, Cable One President and CEO.

         "3 Top Dividend Stocks I Plan to Buy Hand Over Fist This July",
         "I'm a pretty active investor. Cash routinely flows into my brokerage accounts from passive income sources and recurring transfers. I like to immediately put most of the money towork to generate more passive income.\n\nHigh-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks are my go-to investment. I routinely add to my favorite positions. This month, I plan to continue buying shares of Realty Income (NYSE: O), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's why I can't seem to get enough of these top-notch income stocks.\n\nThe name says it all\n\nRealty Income has a phenomenal record of paying dividends. The diversified REIT has declared 647 consecutive monthly dividends. It has increased its payout 126 times since going public in 1994, including for the past 107 straight quarters, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate.\n\nI fully expect that steady upward trend in the payout, which at a 6% yield is well above the S&P 500's 1.3% average, to continue. Realty Income's internal growth drivers -- rising rents and using retained cash flow after paying dividends to fund new investments -- should increase its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by about 2% per share each year. That provides a solid foundation for a steadily rising dividend.\n\nMeanwhile, the company estimates it can add about 0.5% to its FFO per share growth rate for every $1 billion of externally funded acquisitions it makes. Those acquisitions are financed by selling stock and issuing new debt. Realty Income conservatively estimates it can externally fund $4 billion to $6 billion of acquisitions each year. When added to its internal growth drivers, this should push its FFO per share growth rate to about 4% to 5% annually, in line with its historical growth rate. With trillions of dollars in commercial real estate across the U.S. and Europe, Realty Income should have plenty of new investment opportunities.\n\nThe high-powered growth should continue\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure has done an excellent job of increasing its dividend. The global infrastructure operator has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate since 2009.\n\nIt should have plenty of fuel to grow its payout in the future. Brookfield expects a trio of organic drivers -- inflation-indexed rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects funded with retained cash flow after paying dividends -- to boost its FFO per share by 6% to 9% annually. The company has a large backlog of expansion projects underway, including several data center developments and two new semiconductor fabrication facilities it's helping finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of organic growth, Brookfield has an excellent record of making accretive acquisitions. It recently agreed to buy an additional 10% interest in its Brazilian integrated rail and logistics provider, and it's working to purchase a portfolio of telecom towers in India. It's funding these deals by recycling capital. Brookfield believes that acquisitions will help drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. That easily supports its plan to increase its dividend, which yields around 5%, by 5% to 9% per year.\n\nAmple fuel to continue growing\n\nEnbridge has paid dividends to its investors for nearly seven decades. The Canadian pipeline and utility giant has increased its payout every year for the past 29.\n\nThe company should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its dividend, which yields a monster 7.5% these days, for the next several years. It's in the process of closing a once-in-a-generation acquisition of three high-quality gas utilities in the United States. That deal will immediately boost its earnings, enhance its diversification and income stability, and add to its growth profile.\n\nIn addition, the company has a robust organic growth backlog. It has billions of dollars in commercially secured projects under construction that should come online through 2028. These projects should help grow its cash flow per share by 3% annually through 2026 and by a roughly 5% per year pace after that. That visible earnings growth, along with its top-notch financial profile, positions Enbridge to continue increasing its dividend each year.\n\nHigh-quality income stocks\n\nRealty Income, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Enbridge are my ideal income stocks. They pay well above-average dividends, and those payouts should continue rising steadily in the future. Those factors are driving my decision to continue buying these top-notch income stocks hand over fist in July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the household products stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 0.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nClorox (NYSE:CLX)\n\nFounded in 1913 with bleach as the sole product offering, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) today is a consumer products giant whose product portfolio spans everything from bleach to skincare to salad dressing to kitty litter.\n\nClorox reported revenues of $1.81 billion, down 5.3% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 3%. It was a mixed quarter for the company: Clorox exceeded analysts' EPS expectations. Its full-year earnings guidance also exceeded Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its organic revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations and its operating margin missed Wall Street's estimates.\n\n\"During the quarter, we made significant progress on our long-term strategies to drive profitable growth while also continuing to recover from the cyberattack. We executed well against our IGNITE strategy by evolving our portfolio with the divestiture of the Argentina business, launching innovation, investing in our brands, and delivering another quarter of gross margin expansion,\" said Chair and CEO Linda Rendle.

We executed well against our IGNITE strategy by evolving our portfolio with the divestiture of the Argentina business, launching innovation, investing in our brands, and delivering another quarter of gross margin expansion,\" said Chair and CEO Linda Rendle.
