AIN,2021-06-09T05:24:33+00:00,Is Albany International Corp.'s (NYSE:AIN) Recent Performance Tethered To Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,"Most readers would already know that Albany International's (NYSE:AIN) stock increased by 3.1% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Albany International's  ROE today.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

Check out our latest analysis for Albany International

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Albany International is:

14% = US$117m ÷ US$826m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2021).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.14 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

A Side By Side comparison of Albany International's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE

At first glance, Albany International seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. This probably laid the ground for Albany International's moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.

Story continues

We then compared Albany International's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.8% in the same period. past-earnings-growth

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Albany International is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.

Is Albany International Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Albany International's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 22% (implying that it retains 78% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.

Moreover, Albany International is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Albany International's future ROE will be 13% which is again, similar to the current ROE.

Summary

On the whole, we feel that Albany International's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

AIV,2021-06-28T20:24:35+00:00,The company Tesla booted from the S&amp;P 500 is outperforming it,"The company Tesla (TSLA) booted from the S&P 500 index has vastly outperformed the electric automaker by a “stupendous margin,” analysts at Research Affiliates pointed out this week.

Tesla entered the S&P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe.

Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&P 500 does not become the S&P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot.

According to analysis from Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott, Vitali Kalesnik, and Lillian Wu, Apartment Investment and Management, this pattern is not uncommon. Frequently, additions to the index underperform and removed companies often do very well, the authors wrote in a research note.

""Traditional cap-weighted indices routinely buy high and sell low when the index rebalances resulting in substantial hidden costs to investors who track the index,” the note said. “The December 2020 S&P 500 rebalance out of AIV and into TSLA cost investors 41 [basis points] in the first six months, and the cost may go higher.”

In their view, a struggling stock getting kicked out of the index during a rebalancing means getting the axe at a low point. On the other side, a hot new stock getting added to the index is trading at a high point. TSLA vs AIV with the S&P 500 for context. (Yahoo Finance)

The authors pointed out that though index investing is passive, the actual indexes aren’t necessarily passive as the decisions on which companies to include in the S&P 500 is controlled by a committee. And the index changes to compensate for companies’ valuations and new entrants periodically, not automatically.

Story continues

An investor who had $100,000 in, say, an S&P 500 index fund on Dec. 21 when the rebalancing happened would be $410 poorer had no rebalance happened, Research Affiliates calculated.

""Unfortunately, this cost is totally unnoticed by investors because it is baked into the index’s performance,” the authors wrote.

The analysis suggests these are hidden costs of indexing and Tesla’s underperformance and Apartment Investment and Management’s outperformance should have come as no surprise given historical patterns. But of course, there was no guarantee this time was going to be like the previous ones.

But if you think this pattern could be a consistent one, the paper’s authors believe there’s an opportunity to innovate.

“Smarter index design and more efficient implementation could help investors tracking traditional indices avoid these hidden costs,” they wrote.

That may not happen, so they propose another option: If you’re not just an index fund buyer, try doing the opposite of what the index does.

“The index rebalance is a great opportunity to do the opposite of what the index does: buy the deletion and sell the addition,” the authors wrote. “Providing index investors liquidity and benefitting from the mean reversion of the price changes has historically proven to be an excellent investment idea.”

ALF,2021-06-23T09:45:10+00:00,"Alfi Inc shares set to fall from record highs, 'meme stock' Torchlight sinks","(Reuters) -Shares of software firm Alfi Inc fell 10% in early deals on Wednesday after more than doubling in value in the previous session, in a move evocative of the so-called ""meme stock"" frenzy that has gripped equity markets this year.

Alfi's stock was trading at around $14.65 per share by 5:26 a.m. ET after ending Tuesday's session at a record high of $16.29, and was again among the most heavily traded stocks before the bell.

Some social media users and one portfolio manager on Tuesday cited a Benzinga.com report that Alfi planned to buy back stock as helping to fuel the rally.

Shares of a group of heavily shorted companies including video game retailer GameStop Corp and cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc have seen wild swings this year in a phenomenon dubbed the ""meme stock"" rally that has been driven by small-time traders on online discussion forums.

Although short interest in Alfi last stood at 3.85% of free float, according to Refinitiv data, the company was among the top 10 trending stocks on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits, a platform commonly seen as a measure of interest from retail investors.

Another retail darling, Torchlight Energy Resources Inc, sank 10% in premarket trading, extending a 30% slide in the previous session after it upsized its stock offering to $250 million.

GameStop has also cashed in on the Reddit-driven rally in its stock, saying on Tuesday it had raised $1.13 billion in its latest share offering. Its shares were down 0.3% after jumping 10% in the previous session.

AMC shares slid 0.8%, while other meme stocks Clover Health Investments Corp, ContextLogic Inc and Petco Health and Wellness Co rose between 0.4% and 2.4%.

ALKS,2021-06-30T11:00:00+00:00,Alkermes Presented New Data Analysis on Healthcare Resource Use Among Veterans With Alcohol Dependence,"- Retrospective Study of Veterans Health Administration Data Showed an Association Between VIVITROL Treatment and Reduced Emergency Department Visits and Inpatient Hospital Stays -

DUBLIN, June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Alkermes plc (Nasdaq: ALKS) today announced the presentation of new health economics and outcomes research related to healthcare resource use (HRU) among veterans with alcohol dependence at the 2021 Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) Scientific Meeting/International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) Conference, which took place virtually June 19-23, 2021.

The company presented results from a retrospective, observational study using data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) database, which includes healthcare encounters, treatments and laboratory tests at VHA facilities. The study assessed treatment patterns and HRU among 3,665 patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence who were treated with VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension (XR-NTX)).

In the study, VIVITROL treatment for alcohol dependence was associated with decreases in inpatient care and increases in outpatient care during the one-year period following initiation of treatment with VIVITROL, compared to the one-year period before VIVITROL treatment initiation. Specifically:

During the baseline period, defined as the one year before VIVITROL initiation, 61.5 percent of patients had at least one inpatient admission, and 39.8 percent of patients had an emergency department visit. During the follow up period, defined as one year after VIVITROL initiation, 37.8 percent of patients had at least one inpatient admission and 35.4 percent of patients had an emergency department visit.

These HRU changes may reflect a possible transition to less resource-intensive care for veterans initiating VIVITROL. The generalizability of these results to the U.S. population may be limited.

""Alkermes is committed to advancing research on substance use disorders and veterans represent an important demographic given the pervasiveness of alcohol dependence and the broad unmet medical need within the veteran community,"" said Amy O'Sullivan, Vice President, Health Economics & Outcomes Research. ""Though more research is needed, the VHA dataset provides insight into how the use of VIVITROL may impact engagement in treatment, healthcare resource utilization, and health outcomes in this patient population.""

Details of the poster presentation at RSA are as follows:

Poster #240: Treatment Patterns and Healthcare Resource Use Among Patients with Alcohol Dependence who Initiated Extended-Release Naltrexone: An Analysis of Veterans Affairs Data, was presented Sunday, June 20.

Alkermes previously presented data from another retrospective, observational study using the same VHA database at the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS), The Society of Federal Health Professionals, Annual Meeting in December 2020. That study was one of the first studies to provide insights into the patient journey among veterans from alcohol dependence diagnosis to VIVITROL initiation and beyond. Patients studied had extensive health care use and carried a high burden of chronic disease, including hypertension (40.5 percent), chronic pain (10.8 percent), and diabetes (9.7 percent). In addition, a majority had diagnoses for mental health comorbidities, such as depression (74.1 percent), non-alcohol/opioid substance use disorder (66.3 percent), and post-traumatic stress syndrome (52.9 percent). Key findings included:

Although 25 percent of patients initiated VIVITROL within 60 days of diagnosis, the average time from initial diagnosis to VIVITROL initiation was analogous to 13.6 months. While many of the patients studied (75.8 percent) received oral naltrexone prior to initiating VIVITROL, 22.0 percent initiated VIVITROL as first-line medication. Additionally, about half of the patients studied (46.6 percent) did not initiate other alcohol dependence medications during the study period following initiation of treatment with VIVITROL.

About Alcohol Dependence Alcohol dependence is a chronic, relapsing disease that poses serious and potentially fatal health risks.1 In 2017, it affected nearly 8 million people aged 12 and older in the U.S., with a significant burden on veterans.2

About VIVITROL VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. Treatment with VIVITROL should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support. For more information, visit www.vivitrol.com.

INDICATIONS VIVITROL is indicated for:

Treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL. Patients should not be actively drinking at the time of initial VIVITROL administration. Prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support.

CONTRAINDICATIONS VIVITROL is contraindicated in patients:

Receiving opioid analgesics With current physiologic opioid dependence In acute opioid withdrawal Who have failed the naloxone challenge test or have a positive urine screen for opioids Who have exhibited hypersensitivity to naltrexone, polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG), carboxymethylcellulose, or any other components of the diluent

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose:

After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have a reduced tolerance to opioids. VIVITROL blocks the effects of exogenous opioids for approximately 28 days after administration. As the blockade wanes and eventually dissipates completely, use of previously tolerated doses of opioids could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc.). Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients who used opioids at the end of a dosing interval, after missing a scheduled dose, or after discontinuing treatment. Patients and caregivers should be told of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver, at the initial VIVITROL injection and with each subsequent injection. Strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Although VIVITROL is a potent antagonist with a prolonged pharmacological effect, the blockade produced by VIVITROL is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on their own, to overcome the blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids. Any attempt by a patient to overcome the VIVITROL blockade by taking opioids may lead to fatal overdose. Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade.

Injection Site Reactions:

VIVITROL must be prepared and administered by a healthcare provider. VIVITROL injections may be followed by pain, tenderness, induration, swelling, erythema, bruising, or pruritus; however, in some cases injection site reactions may be very severe. In the clinical trials, one patient developed an area of induration that continued to enlarge after 4 weeks, with subsequent development of necrotic tissue that required surgical excision. Injection site reactions not improving may require prompt medical attention, including, in some cases, surgical intervention. Inadvertent subcutaneous/adipose layer injection of VIVITROL may increase the likelihood of severe injection site reactions. Select proper needle size for patient body habitus, and use only the needles provided in the carton. Patients should be informed that any concerning injection site reactions should be brought to the attention of their healthcare provider.

Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal:

When withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by administrationof an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe. Some cases of withdrawal symptoms have been severe enough to require hospitalization, and in some cases, management in the ICU. To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting VIVITROL treatment:

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed. Patients should be made aware of the risk associated with precipitated withdrawal and be encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

Hepatotoxicity:

Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction have been observed in association with VIVITROL. Warn patients of the risk of hepatic injury; advise them to seek help if experiencing symptoms of acute hepatitis. Discontinue use of VIVITROL in patients who exhibit acute hepatitis symptoms.

Depression and Suicidality:

Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients taking VIVITROL should be monitored for depression or suicidal thoughts. Alert families and caregivers to monitor and report the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality.

When Reversal of VIVITROL Blockade Is Required for Pain Management:

For VIVITROL patients in emergency situations, suggestions for pain management include regional analgesia or use of non-opioid analgesics. If opioid therapy is required to reverse the VIVITROL blockade, patients should be closely monitored by trained personnel in a setting staffed and equipped for CPR.

Eosinophilic Pneumonia:

Patients who develop dyspnea and hypoxemia should seek medical attention immediately. Consider the possibility of eosinophilic pneumonia in patients who do not respond to antibiotics.

Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis:

Cases of urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis have been observed with the use of VIVITROL. Patients should be warned of the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention in a healthcare setting prepared to treat anaphylaxis. The patient should not receive any further treatment with VIVITROL.

Intramuscular Injections:

As with any intramuscular injection, VIVITROL should be administered with caution to patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.

Alcohol Withdrawal:

Use of VIVITROL does not eliminate nor diminish alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Interference with Laboratory Tests

VIVITROL may be cross-reactive with certain immunoassay methods for the detection of drugs of abuse (specifically opioids) in urine. For further information, reference to the specific immunoassay instructions is recommended.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The adverse events seen most frequently in association with VIVITROL therapy for alcohol dependence (ie, those occurring in ≥5% and at least twice as frequently with VIVITROL than placebo) include nausea, vomiting, injection site reactions (including induration, pruritus, nodules, and swelling), arthralgia, arthritis, or joint stiffness, muscle cramps, dizziness or syncope, somnolence or sedation, anorexia, decreased appetite or other appetite disorders. The adverse events seen most frequently in association with VIVITROL in opioid-dependent patients (ie, those occurring in ≥2% and at least twice as frequently with VIVITROL than placebo) were hepatic enzyme abnormalities, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, and toothache.

(ZS)?","While the market driven by short-term sentiment influenced by the accommodative interest rate environment in the US, virus news and stimulus spending, many smart money investors are starting to get cautious towards the current bull run since March, 2020 and hedging or reducing many of their long positions. Some fund managers are betting on Dow hitting 40,000 to generate strong returns. However, as we know, big investors usually buy stocks with strong fundamentals that can deliver gains both in bull and bear markets, which is why we believe we can profit from imitating them. In this article, we are going to take a look at the smart money sentiment surrounding Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS).

Is Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) a good investment now? The smart money was becoming less hopeful. The number of long hedge fund positions decreased by 1 in recent months. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) was in 34 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 35. Our calculations also showed that ZS isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind let's take a look at the latest hedge fund action surrounding Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS).

Do Hedge Funds Think ZS Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At first quarter's end, a total of 34 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -3% from one quarter earlier. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards ZS over the last 23 quarters. So, let's examine which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves. Is ZS A Good Stock To Buy?

According to publicly available hedge fund and institutional investor holdings data compiled by Insider Monkey, Two Sigma Advisors, managed by John Overdeck and David Siegel, holds the most valuable position in Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS). Two Sigma Advisors has a $204.3 million position in the stock, comprising 0.6% of its 13F portfolio. Coming in second is Arrowstreet Capital, managed by Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell, which holds a $145.1 million position; 0.2% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the stock. Other peers with similar optimism consist of D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw, and Renaissance Technologies. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position 0 allocated the biggest weight to Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), around 6.28% of its 13F portfolio. 0 is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 2.95 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ZS.

Due to the fact that Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has witnessed a decline in interest from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, logic holds that there lies a certain ""tier"" of hedge funds that slashed their full holdings in the first quarter. At the top of the heap, Alex Sacerdote's Whale Rock Capital Management said goodbye to the largest investment of the ""upper crust"" of funds monitored by Insider Monkey, worth close to $295.1 million in stock, and Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management was right behind this move, as the fund said goodbye to about $55.9 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as aggregate hedge fund interest was cut by 1 funds in the first quarter.

Let's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS). These stocks are PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET), Yandex NV (NASDAQ:YNDX), Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), United Microelectronics Corp (NYSE:UMC), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE), and Baker Hughes Company (NYSE:BKR). This group of stocks' market valuations match ZS's market valuation.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 30.1 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $1268 million. That figure was $810 million in ZS's case. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand United Microelectronics Corp (NYSE:UMC) is the least popular one with only 11 bullish hedge fund positions. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for ZS is 54.4. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and still beat the market by 4.8 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on ZS as the stock returned 27.5% since the end of Q1 (through 6/25) and outperformed the market. Hedge funds were rewarded for their relative bullishness.

ATOM,2021-06-30T12:59:14+00:00,Where Do Hedge Funds Stand On Atomera Incorporated (ATOM)?,"Hedge funds and large money managers usually invest with a focus on the long-term horizon and, therefore, short-lived dips or bumps on the charts usually don't make them change their opinion towards a company. This time it may be different. The coronavirus pandemic destroyed the high correlations among major industries and asset classes. We are now in a stock pickers market where fundamentals of a stock have more effect on the price than the overall direction of the market. As a result we observe sudden and large changes in hedge fund positions depending on the news flow. Let’s take a look at the hedge fund sentiment towards Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM) to find out whether there were any major changes in hedge funds' views.

Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic was previously 4. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. ATOM has experienced an increase in hedge fund interest in recent months. There were 4 hedge funds in our database with ATOM positions at the end of the fourth quarter. Our calculations also showed that ATOM isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today. Alan Howard

At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund owns nearly 40% of this $24 biotech stock and is trying to buy the rest for around $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. With all of this in mind let's take a glance at the latest hedge fund action surrounding Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM).

Do Hedge Funds Think ATOM Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At Q1's end, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of 50% from the fourth quarter of 2020. On the other hand, there were a total of 0 hedge funds with a bullish position in ATOM a year ago. So, let's find out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

The largest stake in Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM) was held by Citadel Investment Group, which reported holding $8.9 million worth of stock at the end of December. It was followed by OZ Management with a $3.1 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Brevan Howard, Citadel Investment Group, and Caxton Associates LP. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Brevan Howard allocated the biggest weight to Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM), around 0.39% of its 13F portfolio. Caxton Associates LP is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 0.04 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ATOM.

As aggregate interest increased, specific money managers have been driving this bullishness. Brevan Howard, managed by Alan Howard, created the biggest position in Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM). Brevan Howard had $2.7 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group also made a $1.5 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The only other fund with a new position in the stock is Greg Eisner's Engineers Gate Manager.

Let's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM) but similarly valued. These stocks are Aldeyra Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:ALDX), HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK), Hess Midstream LP (NYSE:HESM), Duluth Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTH), Earthstone Energy, Inc. (NYSE:ESTE), Banco BBVA Argentina S.A. (NYSE:BBAR), and Ennis, Inc. (NYSE:EBF). This group of stocks' market values resemble ATOM's market value.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 8.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $40 million. That figure was $8 million in ATOM's case. Aldeyra Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:ALDX) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Banco BBVA Argentina S.A. (NYSE:BBAR) is the least popular one with only 4 bullish hedge fund positions. Atomera Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATOM) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for ATOM is 44.7. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and surpassed the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately ATOM wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); ATOM investors were disappointed as the stock returned -4.2% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

AXSM,2021-06-28T05:29:33+00:00,"How Many Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM) Shares Do Institutions Own?","A look at the shareholders of Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.

Axsome Therapeutics has a market capitalization of US$2.8b, so we would expect some institutional investors to have noticed the stock. In the chart below, we can see that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Axsome Therapeutics.

See our latest analysis for Axsome Therapeutics  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Axsome Therapeutics?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Axsome Therapeutics. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Axsome Therapeutics' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Axsome Therapeutics. Antecip Capital, L.L.C. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.4% by the third-largest shareholder.

On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Axsome Therapeutics

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$52m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public, with a 15% stake in the company, will not easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Company Ownership

It seems that Private Companies own 20%, of the Axsome Therapeutics stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Axsome Therapeutics better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Axsome Therapeutics that you should be aware of before investing here.

But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

BCML,2021-06-30T12:59:29+00:00,Is Cedar Realty Trust Inc (CDR) A Good Stock To Buy?,"How do you pick the next stock to invest in? One way would be to spend days of research browsing through thousands of publicly traded companies. However, an easier way is to look at the stocks that smart money investors are collectively bullish on. Hedge funds and other institutional investors usually invest large amounts of capital and have to conduct due diligence while choosing their next pick. They don't always get it right, but, on average, their stock picks historically generated strong returns after adjusting for known risk factors. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the recent hedge fund activity surrounding Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR).

Is CDR a good stock to buy? The best stock pickers were in a bearish mood. The number of long hedge fund positions dropped by 1 lately. Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 15. Our calculations also showed that CDR isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). There were 7 hedge funds in our database with CDR positions at the end of the fourth quarter.

In today’s marketplace there are dozens of gauges stock market investors employ to size up stocks. Two of the most innovative gauges are hedge fund and insider trading sentiment. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the top investment managers can outpace the broader indices by a very impressive amount (see the details here). Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points.

Do Hedge Funds Think CDR Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At the end of March, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -14% from the fourth quarter of 2020. On the other hand, there were a total of 9 hedge funds with a bullish position in CDR a year ago. So, let's see which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

Among these funds, Millennium Management held the most valuable stake in Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR), which was worth $3.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was Barington Capital Group which amassed $3.1 million worth of shares. Cruiser Capital Advisors, Renaissance Technologies, and Two Sigma Advisors were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Barington Capital Group allocated the biggest weight to Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR), around 3.26% of its 13F portfolio. Cruiser Capital Advisors is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 2.12 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to CDR.

Seeing as Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR) has faced falling interest from hedge fund managers, it's safe to say that there was a specific group of hedge funds that elected to cut their positions entirely heading into Q2. Intriguingly, Dmitry Balyasny's Balyasny Asset Management said goodbye to the largest investment of the 750 funds followed by Insider Monkey, worth about $0.6 million in stock, and Michael Gelband's ExodusPoint Capital was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $0.2 million worth. These transactions are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest dropped by 1 funds heading into Q2.

Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR) but similarly valued. These stocks are The Community Financial Corp (NASDAQ:TCFC), BayCom Corp (NASDAQ:BCML), Sequans Communications SA (NYSE:SQNS), SharpSpring, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHSP), Opthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT), Mastech Digital, Inc. (NYSE:MHH), and Points International Ltd (NASDAQ:PCOM). This group of stocks' market values resemble CDR's market value.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 5.4 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $26 million. That figure was $12 million in CDR's case. SharpSpring, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHSP) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand The Community Financial Corp (NASDAQ:TCFC) is the least popular one with only 3 bullish hedge fund positions. Cedar Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:CDR) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for CDR is 37.4. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and still beat the market by 4.8 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on CDR as the stock returned 16.9% since the end of Q1 (through 6/25) and outperformed the market. Hedge funds were rewarded for their relative bullishness.

BGFV,2021-06-18T14:37:53+00:00,Is SMMF Stock A Buy?,"Hedge funds and large money managers usually invest with a focus on the long-term horizon and, therefore, short-lived dips or bumps on the charts usually don't make them change their opinion towards a company. This time it may be different. The coronavirus pandemic destroyed the high correlations among major industries and asset classes. We are now in a stock pickers market where fundamentals of a stock have more effect on the price than the overall direction of the market. As a result we observe sudden and large changes in hedge fund positions depending on the news flow. Let’s take a look at the hedge fund sentiment towards Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF) to find out whether there were any major changes in hedge funds' views.

Is SMMF stock a buy? Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF) shares haven't seen a lot of action during the second quarter. Overall, hedge fund sentiment was unchanged. The stock was in 4 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Our calculations also showed that SMMF isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). At the end of this article we will also compare SMMF to other stocks including DSP Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DSPG), Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ:BGFV), and Farmland Partners Inc (NYSE:FPI) to get a better sense of its popularity.

In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's monthly stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points (see the details here). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund wants to buy this $28 biotech stockfor $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind let's analyze the latest hedge fund action encompassing Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF).

Do Hedge Funds Think SMMF Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

Heading into the second quarter of 2021, a total of 4 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 0% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 2 hedge funds with a bullish position in SMMF a year ago. So, let's examine which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

According to Insider Monkey's hedge fund database, Renaissance Technologies has the biggest position in Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF), worth close to $6.8 million, amounting to less than 0.1%% of its total 13F portfolio. Sitting at the No. 2 spot is Fourthstone LLC, managed by Phil Stone, which holds a $3.4 million position; 1.7% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Other members of the smart money that hold long positions contain Jeffrey Gendell's Tontine Asset Management, Roger Ibbotson's Zebra Capital Management and . In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Fourthstone LLC allocated the biggest weight to Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF), around 1.69% of its 13F portfolio. Zebra Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 0.24 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to SMMF.

We view hedge fund activity in the stock unfavorable, but in this case there was only a single hedge fund selling its entire position: Winton Capital Management. One hedge fund selling its entire position doesn't always imply a bearish intent. Theoretically a hedge fund may decide to sell a promising position in order to invest the proceeds in a more promising idea. However, we don't think this is the case in this case because only one of the 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey identified as a viable investment and initiated a position in the stock (that fund was Zebra Capital Management).

Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF). We will take a look at DSP Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DSPG), Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ:BGFV), Farmland Partners Inc (NYSE:FPI), Kaleido BioSciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:KLDO), Uxin Limited (NASDAQ:UXIN), Village Super Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:VLGEA), and Cardiff Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRDF). This group of stocks' market values are closest to SMMF's market value.

[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position DSPG,13,54197,0 BGFV,14,27074,-3 FPI,5,1965,-3 KLDO,6,7960,4 UXIN,3,5133,0 VLGEA,7,30340,-3 CRDF,13,63864,-5 Average,8.7,27219,-1.4 [/table]

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 8.7 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $27 million. That figure was $11 million in SMMF's case. Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ:BGFV) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Uxin Limited (NASDAQ:UXIN) is the least popular one with only 3 bullish hedge fund positions. Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMF) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for SMMF is 39.5. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and surpassed the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately SMMF wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); SMMF investors were disappointed as the stock returned -11.8% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

(NASDAQ:CTG) and determine whether it is a good investment right now. We at Insider Monkey like to examine what billionaires and hedge funds think of a company before spending days of research on it. Given their 2 and 20 payment structure, hedge funds have more incentives and resources than the average investor. The funds have access to expert networks and get tips from industry insiders. They also employ numerous Ivy League graduates and MBAs. Like everyone else, hedge funds perform miserably at times, but their consensus picks have historically outperformed the market after risk adjustments.

Is CTG a good stock to buy now? Computer Task Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTG) has experienced an increase in activity from the world's largest hedge funds of late. Computer Task Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTG) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 11. Our calculations also showed that CTG isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here).

Millennium Management had $0.1 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter.

Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Computer Task Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTG) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Superior Industries International Inc. (NYSE:SUP), J Alexander's Holdings Inc (NYSE:JAX), Genocea Biosciences Inc (NASDAQ:GNCA), Asure Software Inc (NASDAQ:ASUR), BG Staffing Inc (NYSE:BGSF), Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS), and Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (NYSE:PLX). This group of stocks' market caps match CTG's market cap.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 8.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $23 million. That figure was $31 million in CTG's case. Superior Industries International Inc. (NYSE:SUP) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) is the least popular one with only 3 bullish hedge fund positions. Computer Task Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTG) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for CTG is 39. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and surpassed the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately CTG wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); CTG investors were disappointed as the stock returned 0.5% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

BLDR,2021-06-30T14:53:02+00:00,Builders FirstSource (BLDR) to Buy WTS Paradigm For $450M,"Builders FirstSource, Inc. BLDR has inked an all-cash deal to acquire a software solutions and services provider for the building products industry — WTS Paradigm, LLC. This move marks a step forward for Builders FirstSource in progressing toward a digital strategy in order to create major construction process efficiencies through prudent investments in innovative technologies.

Buyout Synergies

Headquartered in Middleton, WI, Paradigm emphasizes on technology, software development and consulting services, thereby aiding manufacturers, retailers as well as homebuilders in the building products industry to enhance sales, and slash costs.

The Paradigm acquisition will boost Builders FirstSource’s digital competences that will help the company in solving issues arising from the homebuilding process. Meanwhile, Builders FirstSource has plans to continue investing in the core Paradigm Omni configuration technology, which also powers a newer product: Paradigm Omni for Homebuilders, a virtual design technology that reduces friction and improves efficiency.

The acquisition — valued at $450 million — is expected to close in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and antitrust approvals. Upon the transaction’s closure, Paradigm will operate as a subsidiary of Builders FirstSource and is expected to generate revenues of $50 million in 2021.

Digital Evolution: A Boon

Companies across the homebuilding industry have been consistently focusing on investing in modern technologies to enhance customer experience. The progress of the digital era will boost efficiencies in complex homebuilding projects. According to the company, an average residential construction project involves more than 60 material suppliers, 100 sub-contractors and many other service providers. There are several complications while managing a project. Here arises an excellent opportunity for digital technologies to drive the construction process efficiently. To serve customers and employees with better technologies, Builders FirstSource is continuously leveraging technology platforms.

Meanwhile, acquisitions have been one of the preferred modes of solidifying the company’s presence and product portfolio. In May 2021, Builders FirstSource has inked a deal to acquire Arizona’s largest independently operated supplier of building materials — Cornerstone Building Alliance SW, LLC (“Alliance”) — for approximately $400 million. The acquisition will be funded through a combination of existing cash and credit facilities, and is expected to close in second-quarter 2021, subject to customary closing conditions as well as approvals.

In the same month, Builders FirstSource has acquired a family-owned, leading supplier of lumber and other building materials company - John’s Lumber. The acquisition will improve Builders FirstSource’s product portfolio and expand reach within Michigan.

Importantly, on Jan 1, it completed the merger with BMC Stock Holdings — one of the nation’s leading providers of diversified building materials and solutions to new construction builders as well as professional remodelers. BMC’s distinct millwork capability, READY-FRAME offerings and other manufactured products complement Builders FirstSource’s strength in trusses as well as manufactured components, among other offerings. Also, it will now be able to invest more in innovation and develop targeted solutions that will be provided by highly-skilled team members. This enables the company to provide best-in-class service to customers and communities.

BLMN,2021-06-29T11:22:11+00:00,Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) Sees Hammer Chart Pattern: Time to Buy?,"Bloomin' Brands, Inc. BLMN has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because BLMN recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.

What is a Hammer Chart Pattern?

A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.

Other Factors

Plus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 6 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.

Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if BLMN stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.

BLNK,2021-06-28T23:01:00+00:00,Could This Be One Of The Best Ways To Play The EV Boom This Summer?,"Some say that car ownership won’t be a thing of the future.

The future is electric …

And it could be much more than that.

It’s about on-demand cars, virtual showrooms, and an end to insurance, maintenance and commitment.

This is where we get super clean and wildly convenient.

EV sales broke just about every previous EV record in 2020, even in the middle of a pandemic.

EV sales soared by over 40%, while overall car sales dropped by 14%.

And we’re just getting started and now there’s another potential huge disruptor. This one won’t hinder the mainstreaming of EVs, but it could help rock the auto industry to its core.

According to one analyst, the car subscription market is set to top $12 billion by 2027.

Big names are jumping in on this opportunity too, from Volvo and Porsche to Hertz and others.

Washington, D.C.-based Steer, recently acquired by Facedrive (TSX.V:FD; OTCMKTS:FDVRF), isn’t just pursuing this coming megatrend … it’s doing it with EVs. That’s two possible megatrends in one.

Both Facedrive and Steer are tech-driven innovators working in the EV space, where the most lucrative tie-ins appear to be shaping up as major investment opportunities.

Facedrive has made it its mission to turn eco-friendly services into profitable tech-driven verticals.

And Steer is on the right track. It looks like they know what people want, especially one of our most important consumer classes: millennials.

Millennials don’t like hassle, and they want everything on demand, without commitment.

That’s exactly what Steer aims to offer …

An On-Demand Virtual EV Showroom, Hassle Free 
Steer’s all-inclusive car subscription service features 100% electric, plug-in, and hybrid vehicles. And it fully intends to change the way people view car ownership, forever…

For many, the car ownership experience is a dismal one. Steer wants to put an end to haggling with dealers, complicated financing, long-term commitments and even insurance and maintenance. Steer’s subscription service provides something consumers have been after for years: flexibility.

Story continues

We think Steer is one of the answers to the last remaining hurdles of full-on adoption of EVs: cost and charging technology.

A subscription to Steer comes with your own concierge who delivers your car wherever you need it and assists with charging, either at home or on the road. And there’s no mileage limit—one of the banes of car leasing.

With Steer, members get their own virtual gallery to fit various budgets, including everything from the Audi e-Tron and the Hyundai Kona to your favorite Tesla, and beyond.

The growth runways look highly promising. Already, the company reports that 70% of Steer members have never even driven an EV before. In other words, new converts could be coming easily.

One Giant and One In the Making

Facedrive (TSX.V:FD; OTCMKTS:FDVRF) acquired Steer from Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) in a deal that included a $2-million strategic investment by energy giant Exelon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC.

That connects another big name into the Facedrive story to help exert positive change in the auto industry. And the EV industry tie-in couldn’t come at a better time.

We think It’s all positioning Steer to become the Netflix of EV car ‘ownership’.

And Facedrive itself is aiming to become the Netflix of a number of other eco-friendly verticals too.

As far back as 2016, Facedrive was coming up with its potential solution to help reduce the massive pollution caused by ride-hailing. It’s answer to Uber and Lyft? The 2019 launch of the first carbon-offset ride-sharing platform in Canada, giving riders a choice of EV or hybrid and planting trees in cooperation with local authorities along the way.

It also pioneered a model for carbon-offsetting food and pharma deliveries.

That didn’t stop it from jumping in on the front lines of the COVID-19 battle, either. It developed TraceSCAN, the Ontario government-backed COVID contact-tracing wearable technology that is aiming for rapid manufacture and deployment to help enable essential workers to get back on the job - safely - and in turn to help enable the economy to reopen, and stay open.

From Steer to TraceSCAN and Facedrive Foods, this Canadian ‘Silicon Valley’ style company has focused on people and the planet, without sacrificing the pursuit of profits.

It’s straddling multiple potential megatrends at once, and its revenue growth potential might be what investors are eyeing. And the abrupt shift in consumer behavior says Facedrive (TSX.V:FD; OTCMKTS:FDVRF) is definitely one to watch.

Other companies to watch as the electric vehicle boom accelerates:

Tesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) has emerged as one of the fastest-growing stocks of all time. And that’s a big deal for the electric vehicle market. As one of the world’s most exciting -and important- car makers, it has made going green a must in this incredibly competitive industry. Its modern design has become an industry standard. Tesla has single-handedly made electric vehicles cool, and has fueled the dramatic rise in this burgeoning market since its inception.

Elon Musk is truly a visionary of the times. From his electric vehicle innovations and space ambitions to his forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrencies, Elon Musk may well become the first trillionaire, and Tesla shareholders are set to ride the wave. In fact, he released the first Tesla Roadster nearly 15 years ago, making electric vehicles exciting at a time when people were making fun of first-gen electric vehicles. Since its IPO, Tesla’s stock has skyrocketed by over 18,000%. Largely thanks to its innovative approach to the market.

It’s not just about electric cars, either. Tesla has been going wild with its solar and battery business, as well. Tesla’s Solar Roof project has the potential to change the way houses built in the future. It replaces traditional roofs with stronger, and arguably more aesthetically pleasing, solar panels that can power your entire home. And it’s even one of the cheapest sources of electricity in all of the United States.

It wasn’t so long ago that analysts and investors alike were ready to write off their losses and give up on electric vehicle manufacturer Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO). But China’s answer to Tesla’s dominance powered on, eclipsed estimates, and most importantly, kept its balance sheet in line. And it’s paid off. In a big way. Nio Tesla’s largest competitor in China, has also started to offer a batteries-as-a-service concept, in which car buyers can ‘lease’ the battery of their vehicle and save as much as $10,000 on the price of a new vehicle, while also offering buyers the option to swap batteries after a few years of use.

This could be huge for Nio, which is already making major moves. In fact, just last fall, Nio revealed a pair of sedans that even the biggest Tesla die-hard would struggle to pass up. The vehicles, meant to compete with Tesla’s Model 3, could be just what the company needs to pull back control of its local market from Elon Musk’s electric vehicle giant.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has always been a pioneer in the tech world. Ex-CEO Steve Jobs paved the way to a greener future for the company and the industry as a whole. From the products themselves, to the packages they came in, and even the data centers powering them, Steve Jobs, and now Tim Cook have gone above and beyond to cut the environmental impact of his company, and help win over a new generation of investors.

And now, it’s even getting into the transportation business. ""We're focusing on autonomous systems. It's a core technology that we view as very important. We sort of see it as the mother of all AI projects. It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on."" Apple CEO Tim Cook on Apple's plans in the car space. Electric vehicles aren’t likely to be left out, either…

Apple's rumored electric vehicle means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate which is inherently less risky than lithium-ion batteries, which could be a game-changer for the industry as a whole.

Old school automakers shouldn’t be ignored in the alternative transportation boom, either. Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM),  for example, is a leader in the industry. Beginning with the Prius, Toyota has been on the cutting edge of green transportation for years and years. And now, it has developed a fuel cell system module and looks to start selling it after the spring this year in a bid to promote hydrogen use and help the world achieve carbon neutrality goals, the world’s largest car manufacturer said in February.

According to Toyota, the new module can be used by companies developing fuel cell (FC) applications for trucks, buses, trains, and ships, as well as stationary generators.

The fuel cell system module can be directly connected to an existing electrical instrument provided with a motor, inverter, and battery, Toyota said, noting that the modularization significantly improves convenience.

The boom in electric vehicles success has also fueled a boom in other EV-related companies. Blink (NASDAQ:BLNK), for example, an electric vehicle charging company, has risen by over 300% in just a few months, and the sky is the limit for this up-and-comer. And that’s great news for investors, as well.

BLNK has also been particularly active inking new deals, including 26 dual-port Level 2 IQ 200 EV charging stations at key Burger King locations across the Northeast; 20 Blink-owned IQ 200 electric vehicle charging services with Illinois' Blessing Health, and an exclusive seven-year agreement with Lehigh Valley Health Network for the former to own and operate charging stations across the health network's extensive portfolio of locations.

All in all, Blink Charging really is a mature company, having been around for over 2 decades. Its unique proposition is that many of the company's charging stations are both abundant and convenient. Two things that are absolutely key when you need to keep your new electric car on the road.

GreenPower Motor Company (NASDAQ:GP, TSX:GPV) is an emerging company that produces mass electric transportation. At the moment, it is primarily focused on the North American market, but the sky is the limit as the pressure to go green grows. GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks for over ten years. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower’s impact on the sector can’t be ignored.

GreenPower Motor has seen its share price fall significantly from its January highs, but that doesn’t mean investors shouldn’t keep an eye on it. It is a strong company with ambitious goals, and one of the few Canadian automakers making significant moves in the space.

NFI Group (OTCMKTS:NFYEF, TSX:NFI) is another one of Canada’s emerging companies in the electric vehicle space. Not only does it produce transit buses, but it also producers motorcycles. NFI had a difficult start to the year, but it since cut its debt and begun to address its cash flow struggles in a meaningful way. Though it remains down from January highs, NFI offers investors a promising opportunity to get in on the inevitable transition to electric vehicles.

In addition to its increasingly positive financial reports, it is also one of the few in the business that actually pay dividends out to its investors. That’s huge news for investors who would like to take a wait and see approach while still cashing out some dividends in the meantime.

Another great way to get some exposure to the alternative fuel vehicle boom is through stocks like AutoCanada (OTCMKTS: AOCIF, TSX:ACQ). It is a company that operates auto-dealerships through Canada. The company carries a wide variety of new and used vehicles and has all types of financing options available to fit the needs of any consumer. While sales have slumped this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AutoCanada is already seeing a rebound as both buying power and the demand for electric vehicles increases. This runup could even be accelerated as exciting new cars like Ford’s hybrid fuel cell electric vehicle or Toyota’s new line of EVs hit the market.

Year. To date, AutoCanada’s stock price has more than doubled. And this is only the beginning. The economy is finally beginning to recover, more cars are on the road, and people are increasingly looking for cleaner alternatives to their dirty ICE vehicles.

Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR) is major player in the Canadian telecoms sector. It owns a ton of infrastructure throughout Canada and its cloud services and open-source projects look to address some of the biggest issues that its customers might face before the customers even face them. As online gaming depends on solid internet connections, Shaw will likely become a backdoor benefactor in increased online activity. Not only that, it’s growing higher on ESG investors’ lists, as well, thanks to its forward-thinking approach to the environment and it’s governance.

Magna International (TSX:MG) is a really interesting and roundabout way to get in on the explosive commodity market without betting big on one of the new hot stocks tearing up among the millennials right now. More than a decade ago, Magna International was already making major moves in the battery market, investing over half a billion dollars in battery production while the market was still in its infancy. At the time, electric vehicles as we know them had barely hit the scene, with Tesla launching its premiere car just two years prior.

CAMP,2021-06-29T12:04:44+00:00,Where Do Hedge Funds Stand On Aurora Mobile Limited (JG)?,"In this article we will take a look at whether hedge funds think Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG) is a good investment right now. We check hedge fund and billionaire investor sentiment before delving into hours of research. Hedge funds spend millions of dollars on Ivy League graduates, unconventional data sources, expert networks, and get tips from investment bankers and industry insiders. Sure they sometimes fail miserably, but their consensus stock picks historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk factors.

Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG) investors should pay attention to an increase in hedge fund sentiment recently. Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic was previously 3. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that JG isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

In the financial world there are plenty of metrics stock traders can use to value publicly traded companies. Two of the best metrics are hedge fund and insider trading sentiment. Our experts have shown that, historically, those who follow the best picks of the top investment managers can outperform the broader indices by a significant margin (see the details here). Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points.

At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund owns nearly 40% of this $24 biotech stock and is trying to buy the rest for around $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Now let's take a look at the key hedge fund action regarding Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG).

Do Hedge Funds Think JG Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At first quarter's end, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of 100% from one quarter earlier. Below, you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards JG over the last 23 quarters. So, let's find out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

More specifically, Renaissance Technologies was the largest shareholder of Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG), with a stake worth $0.9 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Renaissance Technologies was Millennium Management, which amassed a stake valued at $0.8 million. Citadel Investment Group, Engineers Gate Manager, and Two Sigma Advisors were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Engineers Gate Manager allocated the biggest weight to Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG), around 0.01% of its 13F portfolio. Paloma Partners is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 0.0038 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to JG.

Now, key money managers have jumped into Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG) headfirst. Millennium Management, managed by Israel Englander, established the most valuable position in Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG). Millennium Management had $0.8 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Greg Eisner's Engineers Gate Manager also initiated a $0.2 million position during the quarter. The following funds were also among the new JG investors: John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors, Donald Sussman's Paloma Partners, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group.

Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG). We will take a look at SQZ Biotechnologies Company (NYSE:SQZ), Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE:LCTX), Fidus Investment Corp (NASDAQ:FDUS), CalAmp Corp. (NASDAQ:CAMP), Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGLE), PennantPark Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:PNNT), and Spark Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPKE). All of these stocks' market caps are similar to JG's market cap.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 9.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $82 million. That figure was $3 million in JG's case. Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGLE) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Spark Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPKE) is the least popular one with only 4 bullish hedge fund positions. Aurora Mobile Limited (NASDAQ:JG) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for JG is 45.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and surpassed the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately JG wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); JG investors were disappointed as the stock returned -23.9% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

At Clarivate, we are committed to taking care of our planet and natural resources to build a better, sustainable world. We do this through activities that prioritize our operational eco-efficiency, carbon neutrality, an ethical supply chain code of conduct and making a difference to climate change.

We work closely with our customers, too, contributing our time, knowledge, and resources to help them apply innovation to their environmental initiatives and create products and services aligned with sustainability.

This is the backdrop to a new colleague initiative we’re proud to champion among our colleagues and our customers that we announced on Earth Day (April 22, 2021) to demonstrate support for environmental protection.

The initiative is Element, a resource group for colleagues that’s focused on the environment and climate change and raising public awareness of the environment and our impact on it.

Scaling individual efforts

Instrumental in the creation of Element is Jamie Francis, co-lead of environmental initiatives at Clarivate and a key driver of the Make a Difference to Climate Change initiative we announced in 2020.

Co-leading the Element push with Jamie is Sofía Nogués, Senior External Communications Manager at Clarivate based in Barcelona. She is also the lead at Clarivate on external sustainability communications.

Sofía brings significant experience in environmentalism and unbridled passion for the environment to her role, and what she hopes to achieve with Element in collaboration with colleagues.

In 2019 Sofía completed a 10-day voyage from Aruba to Panama as part of eXXpedition Round the World – an all-women voyage with a mission to explore the causes of and solutions to the ocean pollution crisis and encourage sustainability. She recounted her experiences, noting the environmental devastation caused by plastics and microplastics waste. Subsequently, she wrote a review of new research from Clarivate on the bioplastics innovation landscape.

Story continues

“Element will enable us to provide opportunities for colleagues and for customers to promote activities and behaviours to support our environmental impact around the world. Proactive individual efforts can influence a company’s initiatives and become part of sustainability drives within a company that can make a difference at scale.”

Sofía Nogués, Senior External Communications Manager at Clarivate

Making a real impact

As Clarivate is an acknowledged leader in the science and intellectual property spaces, we want to make a sustainable impact on the environment at scale through supporting innovation by our customers.

This principle is a key driver behind our commitment to environmentalism as practiced in our initiatives on sustainability.

The world is changing, and we have a responsibility to contribute to this change in a positive way by improving how we interact with our environment – both as an organization and as individuals – and supporting our customers to innovate for a healthier, more sustainable, future.

In our Make a Difference to Climate Change initiative, we highlighted that responsibility to act now. Our goal is to be a positive force to impact climate change – one of the defining issues of our time – and be carbon neutral by 2024.

We aim to be one of the most environmentally friendly organizations in the world, and an indispensable partner to our customers, delivering critical data and information to support their innovation for a greener future.

“This is where an initiative like Element can play a huge role,” says Sofía. “If we can encourage and support our colleagues and our customers in a collaborative approach to prioritize caring for the environment, then we can all make an impact through our joint actions. We can make a genuine difference.”

CNA,2021-06-23T16:31:06+00:00,Is Sunrun Inc (RUN) Going to Burn These Hedge Funds?,"In this article we will take a look at whether hedge funds think Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN) is a good investment right now. We check hedge fund and billionaire investor sentiment before delving into hours of research. Hedge funds spend millions of dollars on Ivy League graduates, unconventional data sources, expert networks, and get tips from investment bankers and industry insiders. Sure they sometimes fail miserably, but their consensus stock picks historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk factors.

Is Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN) a buy right now? Money managers were getting less optimistic. The number of bullish hedge fund positions decreased by 7 lately. Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN) was in 41 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 48. Our calculations also showed that RUN isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today. COATUE MANAGEMENT

At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea.

Do Hedge Funds Think RUN Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At Q1's end, a total of 41 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -15% from one quarter earlier. By comparison, 24 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in RUN a year ago. With the smart money's capital changing hands, there exists a select group of key hedge fund managers who were increasing their stakes meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).

When looking at the institutional investors followed by Insider Monkey, Coatue Management, managed by Philippe Laffont, holds the number one position in Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN). Coatue Management has a $1.029 billion position in the stock, comprising 5.6% of its 13F portfolio. The second most bullish fund manager is Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management LLC, with a $427.8 million position; 1% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the stock. Remaining hedge funds and institutional investors that hold long positions contain Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global, Zach Schreiber's Point State Capital and Glen Kacher's Light Street Capital. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Caxton Associates LP allocated the biggest weight to Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN), around 7.54% of its 13F portfolio. Coatue Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 5.64 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to RUN.

Due to the fact that Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN) has witnessed declining sentiment from the aggregate hedge fund industry, it's safe to say that there were a few money managers that decided to sell off their full holdings heading into Q2. It's worth mentioning that Frank Fu's CaaS Capital sold off the largest investment of all the hedgies tracked by Insider Monkey, worth an estimated $105.4 million in stock. Josh Resnick's fund, Jericho Capital Asset Management, also cut its stock, about $84.1 million worth. These transactions are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 7 funds heading into Q2.

Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN) but similarly valued. These stocks are Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:CGC), Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN), Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR), RH (NYSE:RH), Cna Financial Corporation (NYSE:CNA), Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), and Graco Inc. (NYSE:GGG).

As you can see these stocks had an average of 30.3 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $917 million. That figure was $2405 million in RUN's case. RH (NYSE:RH) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:CGC) is the least popular one with only 12 bullish hedge fund positions. Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ:RUN) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for RUN is 61.8. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points.

Unfortunately RUN wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on RUN were disappointed as the stock returned -12.8% since the end of March (through 6/18) and underperformed the market.

Since Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina Sociedad Anonima (NYSE:LOMA) has faced falling interest from the smart money, it's easy to see that there were a few hedge funds that decided to sell off their entire stakes in the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that Charles de Vaulx's International Value Advisers cut the largest investment of all the hedgies tracked by Insider Monkey, worth close to $3 million in stock, and James Dondero's Highland Capital Management was right behind this move, as the fund said goodbye to about $0.5 million worth.

We will take a look at Central Pacific Financial Corp. (NYSE:CPF), Aspira Women's Health Inc. (NASDAQ:AWH), AdvanSix Inc. (NYSE:ASIX), Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SPWH), Solar Capital Ltd. (NASDAQ:SLRC), Compugen Ltd. (NASDAQ:CGEN), and Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI). This group of stocks' market valuations match LOMA's market valuation.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 14 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $87 million. That figure was $51 million in LOMA's case. Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Aspira Women's Health Inc. (NASDAQ:AWH) is the least popular one with only 8 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina Sociedad Anonima (NYSE:LOMA) is even less popular than AWH. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for LOMA is 11. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th but managed to beat the market by 4.8 percentage points. A small number of hedge funds were also right about betting on LOMA, though not to the same extent, as the stock returned 9.8% since the end of March (through June 25th) and outperformed the market as well.

CVX,2021-06-30T22:00:00+00:00,The Best Energy Dividend Stocks Of 2021,"As OPEC+ gets ready for its next meeting to discuss easing its oil output restrictions, both the WTI and Brent benchmarks were trading down nearly 2% on Monday as a cross-section of health experts warned that the new Delta variant of the coronavirus could cause ""dense"" outbreaks in U.S. states with low vaccination rates.

Fears over the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant are causing jitters at a time when the markets are on edge after the Fed jolted traders with a hawkish tilt earlier this month.

In Europe, Portugal, Spain, and Germany have all issued new travel restrictions to control the spread of the new variant while the situation is not much better in Asia with Malaysia set to extend a lockdown; Thailand has announced fresh restrictions while Indonesia is grappling with record-high cases.

Nevertheless, oil prices remain within striking distance of their recent two-year highs, and Wall Street remains largely optimistic about the mid-term oil price outlook.

Piper Sandler says that whereas the backdrop of tighter monetary policy, the trajectory of the economic recovery, and the sustainability of inflation are likely to create some volatility curveballs, they will not be enough to derail the secular bull market.

The optimism has coincided with a breakout season for the S&P 500, with the Energy Sector (XLE) being particularly impressive.

Indeed, the fossil fuel sector is enjoying a rare blowout season: Over the past few earnings seasons, the majority of companies in the energy sector have comfortably beaten Wall Street's expectations

With impressive bottom-line growth, many top energy names are returning more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Companies usually repurchase shares when they believe they are undervalued, a big endorsement for oil and gas bulls.

If you are looking for solid energy dividends, here are the top aristocrats and payout leaders.

#1. Integrated Oil and Gas

Story continues

ExxonMobil

Dividend Yield (Fwd): 5.52%

YTD Returns: 52.9%

The United State's largest integrated oil and gas company, ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM), is also one of the leading dividend aristocrats in the energy sector.

Exxon Mobil Corp has been named to the Dividend Channel ''S.A.F.E. 25'' list, signifying a stock with above-average ''DividendRank'' statistics including a strong 5.52% forward yield, as well as a superb track record of at least two decades of dividend growth.

Last quarter, Exxon reported that industry fuel margins have improved considerably from the fourth quarter but still remain below 10-year-lows due to high product inventory levels as well as market oversupply.

The best part: Cash flow from operating activities clocked in at $9.3 billion, managing to fully fund the dividend and capital expenditures as well pay down debt by over $4 billion.

Chevron Corp.

Dividend Yield (Fwd): 5.15%

YTD Returns: 23.1%

At a time when the vast majority of oil and gas companies have been reporting blowout earnings, America's second-largest E&P company, Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), was a notable laggard, managing to swing to a profit but missing on both top-and bottom-line expectations.

Still, Chevron declared a $1.34/share quarterly dividend, good for a 3.9% increase from the prior dividend of $1.29. The shares now sport an impressive 5.15% forward yield.

Chevron reported Q1 2021 Q1 GAAP earnings dropped to $1.38B, or $0.72/share, from $3.6B, or $1.93/share, in the year-ago period. GAAP EPS of $0.72 was 0.16 below the consensus while revenue of $31.07B (+4.6% Y/Y) missed by $1.48B.

A big offender was Chevron's refining and chemical units, which reported a Q1 profit of just $5M vs. a $1.1B a year ago, which the company attributed to the February winter storm in Texas as well as the continuing impact of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Q1 production of 3,121 was below the consensus of 3139 Mboe/d.

#2. Master Limited Partnerships

For decades, master limited partnerships, or MLPs, have been a source of reliable, high-yield income for energy investors. An MLP is required by law to derive at least 90% of its cash flow from commodities, natural resources, or real estate. They, in turn, distribute cash to shareholders instead of paying dividends as a standard company would. MLPs combine the liquidity of publicly traded companies and the tax benefits of private partnerships because profits are taxed only when investors receive distributions.

The biggest draw of MLPs is that they are considered pass-through entities under the U.S. federal tax code. Whereas most corporate earnings are taxed twice (first through earnings and again through dividends), the pass-through status of MLPs allows them to avoid this double taxation because earnings are not taxed at the corporate level. Another key benefit: Midstream MLPs act as toll collectors for the energy companies that use their pipelines. As such, their cash flows are protected by long-term, take-or-pay agreements, meaning they are less susceptible to commodity price fluctuations.

It's, therefore, hardly surprising that MLPs typically pay the highest distributions in the energy sector. Here are some top payers.

MPLX LP

Dividend Yield (Fwd): 9.52%

YTD Returns: 33.5%

MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX) is an Ohio-based crude oil and natural gas transportation and processing company.

MPLX has been making good progress reducing operating and capital expenses as well as securing and developing joint venture growth projects. In addition, parent company Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) recently completed the sale of its Speedway assets for $21 billion, with the proceeds to be used to pay down debt and shore up the company's balance sheet.

Rattler Midstream LP

Dividend Yield: 8.44%

YTD Returns: 11.3%

Rattler Midstream LP (NASDAQ:RTLR) provides water-related services to oil and gas shale producer Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) in the Permian Basin in West Texas.

Rattler's management has been aggressively cutting back on capital expenditure which has helped support sustained free cash flow generation. Further, Rattler Midstream is not present on all the company acreage of Diamondback Energy which allows it to grow revenue at a time when Diamondback Energy has forecasted a period of no growth.

Other top-paying MLPs are:

Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA)--6.45% Fwd Yield

Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAGP)--6.16% Fwd Yield

Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (NYSE:MMP)--8.48% Fwd Yield

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)--7.62% Fwd Yield

Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI)--6.01% Fwd Yield

The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB)--6.25% Fwd Yield

#3. Exchange Traded Funds

Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE)

AUM: $25.5B

Expense Ratio: 0.12%

Dividend Yield: 3.95%

YTD Returns: 41.1%

With more than $25 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) is the largest dedicated energy fund. It's also the most liquid and also one of the cheapest in the space.

Related: Could East Africa Become The Next Major Oil Hotspot?

XLE tracks the price and yield performance of companies in the Energy Select Sector Index. The index offers investors broad exposure to companies in the oil, gas and energy equipment industries. One shortcoming though is that the ETF has 26 stocks in its portfolio, with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp.(NYSE:CVX) its top holdings.

Vanguard Energy ETF

AUM: $5.1B

Expense Ratio: 0.10%

Dividend Yield: 3.32%

YTD Returns: 45.2%

Vanguard funds are popular for undercutting the competition on costs; the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEARCA:VDE) has remained true to this ethos by offering the lowest pricing in the sector. With 97 stocks in its portfolio--albeit with less AUM-- VDE is better diversified than XLE, though XOM and CVX still play outsized roles.

VDE tracks the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index (IMI)/Energy 25/50, an index consisting of stocks of large- and mid-cap US energy companies.

#4. Renewable Energy

Many renewable energy companies operate in the red and, therefore, do not pay dividends. However, some are notable for their combination of solid financial standing and attractive dividend payouts.

Here are a few.

Clearway Energy

Dividend Yield (Fwd): 4.85%

YTD Returns: -15.0%

New Jersey-based Clearway Energy Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) operates a large-scale U.S. renewable energy portfolio with approximately 4,200 net megawatts (MW) of installed wind and solar generation projects and 2,500 net MW of natural gas generation facilities, as well as a portfolio of district energy systems. Clearway Energy primarily sells electric power under long-term PPAs, enabling it to generate stable cash flows to reliably pay dividends.

Clearway Energy benefits from a close relationship with $54-billion fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners and Clearway Energy Group (CEG), a separate entity that develops renewable energy projects. CEG has more than 10 GW of renewable energy under development, which gives Clearway access to an attractive range of investment and acquisition opportunities.

Clearway has a target to grow its dividend by 5% to 8% annually in the coming years.

NextEra Energy Partners, L.P.

Dividend Yield (Fwd): 3.42%

YTD Returns: 11.1%

NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based clean energy company and America's largest electric utility holding company by market cap. NEE is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy with 45,900 megawatts of generating capacity. The company owns eight subsidiaries, with the largest, NextEra Energy Services, supplying 5 million homes in Florida with electricity.

NextEra Energy Partners, L.P.(NYSE: NEP) is one of NEE's subsidiaries. NextEra Energy Partners, acquires, owns, and manages contracted clean energy projects in the United States. The company owns a portfolio of contracted renewable generation assets consisting of wind and solar projects, as well as contracted natural gas pipeline assets.

NextEra Energy Partners owns interests in dozens of wind and solar projects in the United States., as well as natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas. These contracted projects use leading-edge technology to generate energy from the wind and the sun. The company's management is shooting for 12-15% dividend growth through 2024, making this an ideal stock for income investors.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Hintze's history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance and go directly to 5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Michael Hintze.

Sir Michael Hintze is an American-Australian businessman based in the UK. He graduated from the University of Sydney with a BSc degree in Physics in 1975 and a BE degree in engineering in 1977 from St John's College. Hintze also obtained an MSc degree in Acoustics from the University of New South Wales, an MBA degree from Harvard Business School and an Honorary Doctorate of Business from the University of New South Wales.

Before launching CQS Cayman LP in 1999, Hintze trained in financial services first by working for Salomon Brothers as a fixed income trader and Credit Suisse First Boston. He later moved to London from New York and joined Goldman Sachs as co-head of the UK Shares Product, leaving the firm in 1995. Four years later, CQS Cayman LP was founded.

Hintze's CQS has been highly successful since its launch, as in 2018, its main fund increased by 30%, and the hedge fund has roughly $9 billion in total AUM. This year, the fund launched a new investment strategy in light of 2020's financial losses, where CQS Directional Opportunities lost roughly 36%, and the firm's assets took a hit because of the coronavirus pandemic and the unease it caused in the markets.

Before this change, CQS had largely invested in corporate credit, structured credit, loans, and equities, but after the financial hits from 2020, this is reportedly being altered. CQS is now trying to generate higher returns through an unconstrained approach that will determine the best investment options for the fund in terms of risk management and returns. CQS reportedly seeks out companies with a reputation for producing high-quality products and services. Despite their 2020 losses, CQS is a firm that has proven to be successful in the past and may be resilient in the future by turning crises into opportunities.

CQS Cayman LP has a diverse portfolio, including stocks like Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: BKNG), Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE), ViacomCBS Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAC), Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE: DRI) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG).

Investing is becoming difficult by the day, even for the smart money. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape.

DSWL,2021-06-19T07:48:16+00:00,Interested In Deswell Industries' (NASDAQ:DSWL) Upcoming US$0.10 Dividend? You Have Four Days Left,"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Deswell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:DSWL) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Deswell Industries' shares before the 24th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of July.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.10 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.20 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Deswell Industries has a trailing yield of 4.2% on the current share price of $4.73. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Deswell Industries's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.

Check out our latest analysis for Deswell Industries

If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Deswell Industries's payout ratio is modest, at just 37% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Deswell Industries generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The company paid out 104% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.

Deswell Industries does have a large net cash position on the balance sheet, which could fund large dividends for a time, if the company so chose. Still, smart investors know that it is better to assess dividends relative to the cash and profit generated by the business. Paying dividends out of cash on the balance sheet is not long-term sustainable.

Deswell Industries paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Deswell Industries to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Deswell Industries has grown its earnings rapidly, up 22% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.

Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Deswell Industries's dividend payments are broadly unchanged compared to where they were 10 years ago.

To Sum It Up

Should investors buy Deswell Industries for the upcoming dividend? We're glad to see the company has been improving its earnings per share while also paying out a low percentage of income. However, it's not great to see it paying out what we see as an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Deswell Industries's dividend merits.

While it's tempting to invest in Deswell Industries for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Deswell Industries you should know about.

We wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see, though. Here's a list of interesting dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

EGAN,2021-06-28T17:49:06+00:00,Where Do Hedge Funds Stand On Theratechnologies Inc. (THTX)?,"Hedge funds and large money managers usually invest with a focus on the long-term horizon and, therefore, short-lived dips or bumps on the charts usually don't make them change their opinion towards a company. This time it may be different. The coronavirus pandemic destroyed the high correlations among major industries and asset classes. We are now in a stock pickers market where fundamentals of a stock have more effect on the price than the overall direction of the market. As a result we observe sudden and large changes in hedge fund positions depending on the news flow. Let’s take a look at the hedge fund sentiment towards Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX) to find out whether there were any major changes in hedge funds' views.

Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX) shareholders have witnessed an increase in activity from the world's largest hedge funds recently. Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic was 5. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that THTX isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

In today’s marketplace there are many gauges market participants employ to grade their stock investments. A pair of the less utilized gauges are hedge fund and insider trading moves. Our researchers have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can beat the broader indices by a healthy amount (see the details here).

When looking at the institutional investors followed by Insider Monkey, Guy Levy's Soleus Capital has the largest position in Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX), worth close to $26.9 million, corresponding to 4.8% of its total 13F portfolio.

Some other members of the smart money that hold long positions encompass Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital, Renaissance Technologies and Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Soleus Capital allocated the biggest weight to Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX), around 4.84% of its 13F portfolio. AIGH Investment Partners is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 2.91 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to THTX.

As aggregate interest increased, some big names were breaking ground themselves. Soleus Capital, managed by Guy Levy, established the most outsized position in Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX). Soleus Capital had $26.9 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital also made a $1.3 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The only other fund with a new position in the stock is Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group.

Let's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX) but similarly valued. We will take a look at uCloudlink Group Inc. (NASDAQ:UCL), PowerFleet, Inc. (NASDAQ:PWFL), eGain Corporation (NASDAQ:EGAN), DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ:DRIO), Casper Sleep Inc. (NYSE:CSPR), PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS), and The Liberty Braves Group (NASDAQ:BATRA). All of these stocks' market caps match THTX's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 10.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $41 million. That figure was $43 million in THTX's case. PowerFleet, Inc. (NASDAQ:PWFL) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand uCloudlink Group Inc. (NASDAQ:UCL) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Theratechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:THTX) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for THTX is 53.9. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and surpassed the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately THTX wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); THTX investors were disappointed as the stock returned 0.5% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

ESE,2021-06-24T07:13:16+00:00,Is ESCO Technologies' (NYSE:ESE) 133% Share Price Increase Well Justified?,"ESCO Technologies Inc. (NYSE:ESE) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last quarter. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 133% in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.

See our latest analysis for ESCO Technologies

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During five years of share price growth, ESCO Technologies actually saw its EPS drop 8.3% per year.

Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.

We doubt the modest 0.4% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. In contrast revenue growth of 5.7% per year is probably viewed as evidence that ESCO Technologies is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.

You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-and-revenue-growth

We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. So we recommend checking out this freereport showing consensus forecasts

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of ESCO Technologies, it has a TSR of 139% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

Story continues

A Different Perspective

ESCO Technologies shareholders gained a total return of 16% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 19% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  3 warning signs for ESCO Technologies  you should know about.

Of course ESCO Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of growth stocks.

FFIN,2021-06-28T13:55:34+00:00,Planet Fitness Inc (PLNT) Fell Out Of Favor With Hedge Funds,"Before we spend countless hours researching a company, we like to analyze what insiders, hedge funds and billionaire investors think of the stock first. This is a necessary first step in our investment process because our research has shown that the elite investors' consensus returns have been exceptional. In the following paragraphs, we find out what the billionaire investors and hedge funds think of Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT).

Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT) has experienced a decrease in activity from the world's largest hedge funds of late. Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT) was in 40 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 47. There were 47 hedge funds in our database with PLNT positions at the end of the fourth quarter. Our calculations also showed that PLNT isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. Third Point

Do Hedge Funds Think PLNT Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At the end of March, a total of 40 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -15% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in PLNT over the last 23 quarters. With hedgies' sentiment swirling, there exists a select group of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes considerably (or already accumulated large positions). Is PLNT A Good Stock To Buy?

Among these funds, SRS Investment Management held the most valuable stake in Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT), which was worth $544.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was Steadfast Capital Management which amassed $157.5 million worth of shares. Broad Bay Capital, Bloom Tree Partners, and Atreides Management were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Broad Bay Capital allocated the biggest weight to Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT), around 11.25% of its 13F portfolio. Deep Field Asset Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 9.64 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to PLNT.

Due to the fact that Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT) has experienced a decline in interest from the smart money, we can see that there is a sect of hedge funds who were dropping their positions entirely by the end of the first quarter. At the top of the heap, Dan Loeb's Third Point dumped the biggest investment of the ""upper crust"" of funds monitored by Insider Monkey, valued at about $179 million in stock. Ryan Frick and Oliver Evans's fund, Dorsal Capital Management, also dumped its stock, about $64 million worth. These bearish behaviors are intriguing to say the least, as total hedge fund interest dropped by 7 funds by the end of the first quarter.

Let's go over hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT). These stocks are Texas Roadhouse Inc (NASDAQ:TXRH), C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), First Financial Bankshares Inc (NASDAQ:FFIN), Old Republic International Corporation (NYSE:ORI), Rexford Industrial Realty Inc (NYSE:REXR), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and Shift4 Payments, Inc.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 21.7 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $275 million. That figure was $1181 million in PLNT's case. Shift4 Payments, Inc. (NYSE:FOUR) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand First Financial Bankshares Inc (NASDAQ:FFIN) is the least popular one with only 11 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE:PLNT) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for PLNT is 73.5. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and still beat the market by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately PLNT wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on PLNT were disappointed as the stock returned 1.1% since the end of the first quarter (through 6/25) and underperformed the market.

These freshly-submitted public filings disclose money managers’ equity positions as of the end of the three-month period that ended March 31st, so let’s proceed with the discussion of the hedge fund sentiment on Taseko Mines Limited (NYSE:TGB).

Is TGB a good stock to buy? Hedge fund interest in Taseko Mines Limited (NYSE:TGB) shares was flat at the end of last quarter. This is usually a negative indicator. Our calculations also showed that TGB isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). At the end of this article we will also compare TGB to other stocks including Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT), Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:FHTX), and Atlanticus Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:ATLC) to get a better sense of its popularity.

At the moment there are a large number of indicators market participants use to grade stocks. Two of the most under-the-radar indicators are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the top hedge fund managers can outpace their index-focused peers by a healthy amount (see the details here).

Do Hedge Funds Think TGB Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At first quarter's end, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 0% from the previous quarter. By comparison, 4 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in TGB a year ago. With hedgies' capital changing hands, there exists a select group of key hedge fund managers who were adding to their holdings meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).

Among these funds, Renaissance Technologies held the most valuable stake in Taseko Mines Limited (NYSE:TGB), which was worth $15.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was Moore Global Investments which amassed $2.9 million worth of shares. Two Sigma Advisors, BlueCrest Capital Mgmt., and Citadel Investment Group were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Moore Global Investments allocated the biggest weight to Taseko Mines Limited (NYSE:TGB), around 0.04% of its 13F portfolio. Renaissance Technologies is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 0.02 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to TGB.

We view hedge fund activity in the stock unfavorable, but in this case there was only a single hedge fund selling its entire position: Millennium Management. One hedge fund selling its entire position doesn't always imply a bearish intent. Theoretically a hedge fund may decide to sell a promising position in order to invest the proceeds in a more promising idea. However, we don't think this is the case in this case because only one of the 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey identified as a viable investment and initiated a position in the stock (that fund was Moore Global Investments).

Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Taseko Mines Limited (NYSE:TGB) but similarly valued. These stocks are Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT), Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:FHTX), Atlanticus Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:ATLC), AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL), Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCAP), Hoegh LNG Partners LP (NYSE:HMLP), and FLEX LNG Ltd. (NYSE:FLNG). All of these stocks' market caps are closest to TGB's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 6.4 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $37 million. That figure was $21 million in TGB's case.

Taseko Mines Limited (NYSE:TGB) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for TGB is 50.2. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points.

Notably, the company has joined forces with Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC to develop the new probe system that operates at 4 Kelvin and below. This has increased the scale of production, which in turn makes it ideal for speeding up the development process of superconducting compute applications.

The latest move has expanded FormFactor’s portfolio of probe systems, which is likely to boost its reach in the cryogenic test and measurement space.

Expanding Cryogenic Equipment Market

The cryogenic equipment market is growing in recent times due to increasing demand for industrial gases and growing investments in liquefied natural gas infrastructure.

According to a report by The Expresswire mentioned in the MarketWatch, the global cryogenic equipment market is expected to hit $21 billion by 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 3.8% between 2021 and 2027.

Moreover, per RESEARCHANDMARKETS report, this particular market is likely to reach $18 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 6.1% during the period of 2020-2027.

FormFactor remains well poised to capitalize on the aforementioned prospects by delivering products enabling cryogenic test and measurement.

Apart from the latest move, the company introduced High Precision Devices IQ1000 scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscope, an automated cryogenic system for the quantum computing market development.

Growing Probe Card Market Leveling Up Competition

The global probe card market is witnessing a significant rise, thanks to increasing wafer size and investment in fabs.

According to a 360 Research report the global probe card market is anticipated to reach $2 billion by 2026, progressing at a CAGR of 4% between 2021 and 2026.

Also, a report by Technavio mentioned in a businesswire release reveals that this particular market is likely to hit $505 million by 2024, witnessing a CAGR of more than 5% during the period of 2020-2024.

Story continues

On account of the abovementioned prospects, FormFactor is facing intense competition in the probe card market from other players including Advantest Corporation ATEYY, MPI Corporation, Micro Square Technology and Feinmetall GmbH.

Nevertheless, FormFactor’s growing initiatives toward maintaining accuracy, speed and frequency of the probe card will continue to give it a competitive edge.

Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider

Currently, FormFactor carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Advanced Micro Devices AMD, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Our calculations also showed that DLHC isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). There were 8 hedge funds in our database with DLHC holdings at the end of December.

In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount.

GBDC,2021-06-29T12:43:16+00:00,"Hedge Funds Are Buying Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (ASO)","We know that hedge funds generate strong, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, therefore imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors. With billions of dollars in assets, smart money investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd. This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do (like Melvin Capital's recent GameStop losses). However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity. With this in mind, as the current round of 13F filings has just ended, let’s examine the smart money sentiment towards Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO).

Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO) has seen an increase in hedge fund interest recently. Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO) was in 37 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic was previously 26. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that ASO isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

According to most stock holders, hedge funds are assumed to be underperforming, outdated financial vehicles of the past. While there are greater than 8000 funds trading at the moment, Our researchers choose to focus on the aristocrats of this club, about 850 funds. It is estimated that this group of investors preside over the majority of all hedge funds' total asset base, and by paying attention to their highest performing investments, Insider Monkey has formulated numerous investment strategies that have historically surpassed Mr. Market. Insider Monkey's flagship short hedge fund strategy outstripped the S&P 500 short ETFs by around 20 percentage points annually since its inception in March 2017. Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points.

HOV,2021-06-28T08:55:32+00:00,Hovnanian Enterprises (NYSE:HOV) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital,"What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, Hovnanian Enterprises (NYSE:HOV) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Hovnanian Enterprises is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.10 = US$197m ÷ (US$2.3b - US$394m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2021).

Thus, Hovnanian Enterprises has an ROCE of 10%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Consumer Durables industry average it falls behind.

See our latest analysis for Hovnanian Enterprises  roce

Historical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Hovnanian Enterprises' ROCE against it's prior returns. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of Hovnanian Enterprises, check out these freegraphs here.

How Are Returns Trending?

Hovnanian Enterprises is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 186% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.

In Conclusion...

In summary, we're delighted to see that Hovnanian Enterprises has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a staggering 131% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.

One final note, you should learn about the  3 warning signs  we've spotted with Hovnanian Enterprises (including 2 which can't be ignored) .

As you can see these stocks had an average of 13.1 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $80 million. That figure was $54 million in RTLR's case. Immunovant, Inc. (NASDAQ:IMVT) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Delek Logistics Partners LP (NYSE:DKL) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Rattler Midstream LP (NASDAQ:RTLR) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for RTLR is 23. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and surpassed the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately RTLR wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); RTLR investors were disappointed as the stock returned 4.5% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

INVA,2021-06-19T00:58:30+00:00,Is CNXN Stock A Buy Here?,"Most investors tend to think that hedge funds and other asset managers are worthless, as they cannot beat even simple index fund portfolios. In fact, most people expect hedge funds to compete with and outperform the bull market that we have witnessed in recent years. However, hedge funds are generally partially hedged and aim at delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns rather than following the ups and downs of equity markets hoping that they will outperform the broader market. Our research shows that certain hedge funds do have great stock picking skills (and we can identify these hedge funds in advance pretty accurately), so let’s take a glance at the smart money sentiment towards PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN).

Is CNXN stock a buy? The smart money was getting less bullish. The number of long hedge fund bets were cut by 1 in recent months. PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN) was in 4 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 15. Our calculations also showed that CNXN isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). There were 5 hedge funds in our database with CNXN holdings at the end of December.

In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's monthly stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points (see the details here). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

With all of this in mind let's review the latest hedge fund action regarding PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN).

Do Hedge Funds Think CNXN Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At Q1's end, a total of 4 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -20% from the fourth quarter of 2020. On the other hand, there were a total of 10 hedge funds with a bullish position in CNXN a year ago. So, let's examine which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

According to Insider Monkey's hedge fund database, Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates has the biggest position in PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN), worth close to $20.3 million, comprising 0.1% of its total 13F portfolio. On Royce & Associates's heels is Citadel Investment Group, managed by Ken Griffin, which holds a $2.3 million position; less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the company. Some other peers that are bullish encompass Roger Ibbotson's Zebra Capital Management, Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management and . In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Zebra Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN), around 1.34% of its 13F portfolio. Royce & Associates is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 0.14 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to CNXN.

Because PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN) has witnessed a decline in interest from hedge fund managers, we can see that there lies a certain ""tier"" of hedgies that elected to cut their entire stakes by the end of the first quarter. Intriguingly, Valerie Malter's Matarin Capital dropped the largest investment of the 750 funds monitored by Insider Monkey, totaling about $2.4 million in stock. David Harding's fund, Winton Capital Management, also sold off its stock, about $1.2 million worth. These moves are interesting, as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds by the end of the first quarter.

Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN) but similarly valued. These stocks are NextGen Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:NXGN), Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ:INVA), Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE), Meredith Corporation (NYSE:MDP), Merchants Bancorp (NASDAQ:MBIN), Radware Ltd. (NASDAQ:RDWR), and MYR Group Inc (NASDAQ:MYRG). This group of stocks' market caps resemble CNXN's market cap.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 18.1 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $161 million. That figure was $25 million in CNXN's case. Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Merchants Bancorp (NASDAQ:MBIN) is the least popular one with only 13 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks PC Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNXN) is even less popular than MBIN. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for CNXN is 12. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Hedge funds dodged a bullet by taking a bearish stance towards CNXN. Our calculations showed that the top 10 most popular hedge fund stocks returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th but managed to beat the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately CNXN wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was very bearish); CNXN investors were disappointed as the stock returned 3.2% since the end of the first quarter (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.

Showcased 810 Laser and PASCAL Synthesis™ at the 2021 Hawaiian Eye Meeting in May

“We enjoyed a strong start to 2021 and our positive momentum continued with revenue that exceeded pre-COVID levels, setting a record for first quarter revenue. During the quarter, we saw international adoption of our Cyclo G6 probes rebound strongly, leading to a new first quarter high in Cyclo G6 probe sales. Additionally, we saw strong performance in our retina business, which was further bolstered by the initial sales of PASCAL products acquired from Topcon,” said David I. Bruce, President and CEO of Iridex.

“The investments we made in our product portfolio over the past year and a half are really starting to pay off for the company, particularly with respect to our enhanced retina products. Our focus is now shifting to expand our sales and marketing programs, where we are broadening efforts to demonstrate the many benefits of our non-incisional glaucoma therapy. We intend to leverage our strengthened balance sheet following the Topcon transaction, and pursue the expanding global opportunities we see in both our glaucoma and retina product portfolios,” concluded Bruce.

First Quarter 2021 Financial Results
Revenue for the three months ending April 3, 2021 increased 33% to $12.0 million from $9.0 million during the same period of the prior year. Excluding newly acquired PASCAL products, revenue increased 19% over the first quarter of 2020.

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2021 increased to $4.9 million, a 41% gross margin, compared to $3.9 million, a 43% gross margin, in the same period last year. The gross margin reduction was primarily attributable to a higher portion of revenue coming from wholesale capital equipment sales.

Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 increased 22% to $6.8 million compared to $5.6 million in the same period of the prior year, mainly due to additional expenses in PASCAL operations and non-recurring Topcon transaction and integration expenses.

Net Loss for the first quarter of 2021 was $2.0 million, compared to $1.7 million in the same period of the prior year. Net Loss on a per share basis was $0.14 versus $0.12 last year.

Cash usage in the first quarter was $1.1 million, including approximately $0.5 million of non-recurring Topcon transaction payments, which resulted in cash of $28 million at quarter-end.

Guidance for Full Year 2021
Iridex expects total revenue for fiscal year 2021 to be $48 million to $51 million, reflecting growth of 32% - 40% over fiscal year 2020. In addition, Cyclo G6 probe sales of 56,000 to 59,000 and Glaucoma Laser System sales of 250 to 275 are expected in 2021.

JHG,2021-06-30T15:45:03+00:00,Why Janus Henderson Group plc (JHG) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.

Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.

Janus Henderson Group plc in Focus

Headquartered in London, Janus Henderson Group plc (JHG) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 18.58% so far this year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.38 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.94%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Management industry's yield of 1.55% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.34%.

Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.52 is up 5.6% from last year. Janus Henderson Group plc has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11.12%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Janus Henderson Group plc's current payout ratio is 43%. This means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.

JHG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 is $3.70 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 22.92%.

Bottom Line

Story continues

Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.

Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, JHG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Buy These 5 Low-Beta Stocks to Combat a Choppy Market

Coronavirus vaccines are rolling out at a healthy pace, making scope for more people to socialize and attend office. Despite this, markets have become volatile on rising anticipation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as early as next year to quell the inflation worries.

Hence, creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks is of utmost importance since the securities will not only deliver healthy returns but also provide a shield against choppy market conditions.

Meaning of Beta

Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security's price movement relative to the market. In this article, we are considering the S&P 500 as the market.

If a stock has a beta of 1, then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1.

For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with a beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20%, the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating.

LOPE,2021-06-05T16:57:11+00:00,Why Grand Canyon Education Stock Fell 16% in May,"Shares of Grand Canyon Education (Nasdaq: LOPE) were heading lower last month after the for-profit educator offered disappointing guidance in its first-quarter earnings report. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished May down 16%. The company posted 6.5% revenue growth to $236.9 million, which topped estimates at $235 million.",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0814bb69-ebf5-359d-b795-7e55f753b1d1/why-grand-canyon-education.html?.tsrc=rss,['LOPE.US'],"['GRAND CANYON EDUCATION', 'REVENUE GROWTH', 'S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE']"
LPX,2021-06-28T12:19:41+00:00,Where Do Hedge Funds Stand On Popular Inc (BPOP)?,"Although the masses and most of the financial media blame hedge funds for their exorbitant fee structure and disappointing performance, these investors have proved to have great stock picking abilities over the years (that's why their assets under management continue to swell). We believe hedge fund sentiment should serve as a crucial tool of an individual investor’s stock selection process, as it may offer great insights of how the brightest minds of the finance industry feel about specific stocks. After all, these people have access to smartest analysts and expensive data/information sources that individual investors can't match. So should one consider investing in Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP)? The smart money sentiment can provide an answer to this question.

Is Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP) a buy, sell, or hold? The smart money was in a pessimistic mood. The number of long hedge fund bets were trimmed by 1 lately. Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP) was in 34 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 35. Our calculations also showed that BPOP isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings.

At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. With all of this in mind let's review the new hedge fund action encompassing Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP).

Do Hedge Funds Think BPOP Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At Q1's end, a total of 34 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -3% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 28 hedge funds with a bullish position in BPOP a year ago. With hedge funds' capital changing hands, there exists an ""upper tier"" of key hedge fund managers who were upping their holdings meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions). Is BPOP A Good Stock To Buy?

Among these funds, Polaris Capital Management held the most valuable stake in Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP), which was worth $280.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was Citadel Investment Group which amassed $123.8 million worth of shares. AQR Capital Management, Arctis Global, and Arrowstreet Capital were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Arctis Global allocated the biggest weight to Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP), around 10.2% of its 13F portfolio. Polaris Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 9.21 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to BPOP.

Due to the fact that Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP) has witnessed a decline in interest from the smart money, logic holds that there is a sect of hedgies that slashed their positions entirely last quarter. It's worth mentioning that Renaissance Technologies dumped the biggest position of the ""upper crust"" of funds monitored by Insider Monkey, worth about $6.9 million in stock. David Harding's fund, Winton Capital Management, also said goodbye to its stock, about $1.4 million worth. These moves are interesting, as total hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds last quarter.

Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP) but similarly valued. We will take a look at SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE:SNX), Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SRPT), Duck Creek Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCT), First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:FR), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX), Colfax Corporation (NYSE:CFX), and New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB). All of these stocks' market caps resemble BPOP's market cap.

[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position SNX,15,614677,-9 SRPT,33,526911,-4 DCT,19,310721,-3 FR,20,416925,-6 LPX,30,771996,-11 CFX,49,1009256,13 NYCB,25,329163,0 Average,27.3,568521,-2.9 [/table]

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 27.3 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $569 million. That figure was $874 million in BPOP's case. Colfax Corporation (NYSE:CFX) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE:SNX) is the least popular one with only 15 bullish hedge fund positions. Popular Inc (NASDAQ:BPOP) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for BPOP is 61.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and still beat the market by 4.8 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on BPOP, though not to the same extent, as the stock returned 11.8% since Q1 (through June 25th) and outperformed the market as well.

MMLP,2021-06-30T14:26:39+00:00,Is Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (CORR) A Good Stock To Buy?,"In this article we will check out the progression of hedge fund sentiment towards Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR) and determine whether it is a good investment right now. We at Insider Monkey like to examine what billionaires and hedge funds think of a company before spending days of research on it. Given their 2 and 20 payment structure, hedge funds have more incentives and resources than the average investor. The funds have access to expert networks and get tips from industry insiders. They also employ numerous Ivy League graduates and MBAs. Like everyone else, hedge funds perform miserably at times, but their consensus picks have historically outperformed the market after risk adjustments.

Is CORR a good stock to buy? Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 11. CORR investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money of late. There were 10 hedge funds in our database with CORR holdings at the end of December. Our calculations also showed that CORR isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund owns nearly 40% of this $24 biotech stock and is trying to buy the rest for around $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind we're going to review the recent hedge fund action surrounding Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR).

Do Hedge Funds Think CORR Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At the end of the first quarter, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -40% from one quarter earlier. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in CORR over the last 23 quarters. So, let's see which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

When looking at the institutional investors followed by Insider Monkey, Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital has the largest position in Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR), worth close to $2.1 million, accounting for less than 0.1%% of its total 13F portfolio. Coming in second is Renaissance Technologies, which holds a $1.8 million position; less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the stock. Some other professional money managers with similar optimism include John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Two Sigma Advisors allocated the biggest weight to Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR), around 0.0031% of its 13F portfolio. Arrowstreet Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 0.0028 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to CORR.

Judging by the fact that Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR) has witnessed a decline in interest from the smart money, it's easy to see that there lies a certain ""tier"" of funds who were dropping their positions entirely by the end of the first quarter. Interestingly, Israel Englander's Millennium Management said goodbye to the largest investment of the ""upper crust"" of funds followed by Insider Monkey, valued at an estimated $0.5 million in stock, and Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was right behind this move, as the fund dumped about $0.4 million worth. These moves are intriguing to say the least, as total hedge fund interest fell by 4 funds by the end of the first quarter.

Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR) but similarly valued. These stocks are Lumos Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUMO), OpGen, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN), CLPS Incorporation (NASDAQ:CLPS), AstroNova, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALOT), HMN Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:HMNF), Weidai Ltd. (NYSE:WEI), and Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (NASDAQ:MMLP). This group of stocks' market caps are similar to CORR's market cap.

[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position LUMO,4,17428,-5 OPGN,3,339,2 CLPS,2,321,-1 ALOT,6,17218,-1 HMNF,3,17961,0 WEI,2,369,1 MMLP,1,26,0 Average,3,7666,-0.6 [/table]

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 3 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $8 million. That figure was $5 million in CORR's case. AstroNova, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALOT) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (NASDAQ:MMLP) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Corenergy Infrastructure Trust Inc (NYSE:CORR) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for CORR is 67.4. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and beat the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately CORR wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on CORR were disappointed as the stock returned -1.5% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as many of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.

NWE,2021-06-21T13:49:57+00:00,A Look At The Fair Value Of NorthWestern Corporation (NASDAQ:NWE),"How far off is NorthWestern Corporation (NASDAQ:NWE) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!

We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

Check out our latest analysis for NorthWestern

Crunching the numbers

We have to calculate the value of NorthWestern slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.8%. Compared to the current share price of US$61.3, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)

= US$2.6 / (5.8% – 2.0%)

Story continues

= US$68.9 dcf

The assumptions

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NorthWestern as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Looking Ahead:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For NorthWestern, we've put together three relevant items you should look at:

Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for NorthWestern  (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about. Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for NWE's future outlook?

(CSSE)","In this article we will analyze whether Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSSE) is a good investment right now by following the lead of some of the best investors in the world and piggybacking their ideas. There's no better way to get these firms' immense resources and analytical capabilities working for us than to follow their lead into their best ideas. While not all of these picks will be winners, our research shows that these picks historically outperformed the market by double digits annually.

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSSE) has seen an increase in enthusiasm from smart money lately. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSSE) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic was 5. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that CSSE isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today. Millennium Management, Catapult Capital Management

Do Hedge Funds Think ASRT Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At Q1's end, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -14% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 13 hedge funds with a bullish position in ASRT a year ago. So, let's check out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

More specifically, Highbridge Capital Management was the largest shareholder of Assertio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ASRT), with a stake worth $4.2 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Highbridge Capital Management was Renaissance Technologies, which amassed a stake valued at $2.7 million. D E Shaw, Citadel Investment Group, and Citadel Investment Group were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Highbridge Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to Assertio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ASRT), around 0.17% of its 13F portfolio. Renaissance Technologies is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 0.0033 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ASRT.

Since Assertio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ASRT) has witnessed a decline in interest from the aggregate hedge fund industry, logic holds that there is a sect of hedge funds who sold off their full holdings by the end of the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital dumped the biggest investment of the ""upper crust"" of funds watched by Insider Monkey, comprising about $0.1 million in stock. David Harding's fund, Winton Capital Management, also sold off its stock, about $0.1 million worth. These transactions are intriguing to say the least, as total hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds by the end of the first quarter.

Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Assertio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ASRT) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Performant Financial Corp (NASDAQ:PFMT), TDH Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETZ), OFS Capital Corp (NASDAQ:OFS), Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRVS), Prudential Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:PBIP), One Stop Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:OSS), and Liquidia Corporation (NASDAQ:LQDA). This group of stocks' market values resemble ASRT's market value.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 4.9 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $15 million. That figure was $8 million in ASRT's case. Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRVS) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Prudential Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:PBIP) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Assertio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ASRT) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for ASRT is 38. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and beat the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately ASRT wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on ASRT were disappointed as the stock returned -40.4% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as many of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.

PFBC,2021-06-30T10:06:41+00:00,What Kind Of Investors Own Most Of Preferred Bank (NASDAQ:PFBC)?,"If you want to know who really controls Preferred Bank (NASDAQ:PFBC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Warren Buffett said that he likes ""a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people."" So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Preferred Bank has a market capitalization of US$952m, so we would expect some institutional investors to have noticed the stock. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it seems that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about Preferred Bank.

See our latest analysis for Preferred Bank  ownership-breakdown

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Preferred Bank?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

Preferred Bank already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Preferred Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Preferred Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. With 7.6% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Li Yu directly holds 5.1% of the total shares outstanding.

Story continues

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Preferred Bank

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Preferred Bank. It has a market capitalization of just US$952m, and insiders have US$80m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

With a 14% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over Preferred Bank. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Preferred Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Preferred Bank  you should know about.

POOL,2021-06-30T20:56:24+00:00,10 Best ESG Stocks to Buy Now,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best ESG stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to the 5 Best ESG Stocks to Buy Now.

The internet is abuzz with speculation around the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) practices at large corporations as a younger generation, that takes these issues very seriously, enters the workforce and begins to enact change in this regard. Already, the debate around the ESG movement, led by companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), has begun to have a chain reaction around the world.

For investors keen on averaging handsome returns from their portfolios, the ESG-related metrics at top corporations are becoming an important part of the discussions around big money movement. Governmental policies designed to encourage ESG-related reforms, such as the American Jobs Plan by United States President Joe Biden, and aggressive online activism through internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter, have all provided additional incentives to businesses to change their policies to better align with responsible ESG practices.

Another important statistic that highlights the shift towards ESG is the increase in the number of institutional investors at companies over the past few decades. According to a study, institutional investors have nearly doubled their ownership in stocks since the early eighties, rising from 35% in 1982 to close to 60% by 2002, a number that has climbed higher over the past decade. These institutional investors tend to strategize in the long-term preferring to invest in firms with strong business fundamentals, often associated with responsible ESG practices.

However, in recent months, the influx of retail investors in the market has reversed the tide in this regard somewhat. The ease of stock market access, through trading applications like Robinhood, has exposed a new generation of investors to the stock world. These investors often do not see eye to eye with big finance, and bet against hedge funds shorting stocks. Despite this new dynamic, ESG remains central to the overall outlook on any firm, illustrated by the dramatic fall in the price of crypto stocks recently amid sustainability concerns.

The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices.

As with all our MVP companies, we continued to follow NVIDIA closely. Since that time, NVIDIA reported excellent results and its value has compounded rapidly. The technology selloff at the beginning of the year negatively affected the stock price while our estimate of NVIDIA’s value per share increased. This happy combination of events created a margin of safety and an opportunity to once again add NVIDIA to the portfolio.”

Both diluted and basic earnings per share increased primarily due to higher net interest income.  Compared to the third quarter of 2019, diluted and basic earnings per share decreased by 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively, driven primarily by a lower net interest margin, a decrease in non-interest income, and an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $31.70 million, a 14.7% increase compared to net income of $27.63 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Our year-to-date net income per diluted common share increased $0.07 to $2.59 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.52 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by higher net interest income and an increase in non-interest income.  Our basic and diluted earnings per share were also impacted by our successful capital raise in September 2018, when we issued 1.6 million additional shares of common stock.

Quarterly Highlights

Net income grew by 11.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and decreased by 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2019.Period end loans grew 17.8%, or $370.1 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and grew 3.7%, or $88.4 million, compared to the third quarter of 2019.Period end deposits grew 12.3%, or $256.4 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and grew 0.3%, or $7.9 million, compared to the third quarter of 2019.Net interest margin was 3.40% for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 3.75% for the fourth quarter of 2018, and 3.57% for the third quarter of 2019.  The margin decrease in the fourth quarter was due to a material increase in our average cash balances compared to the prior quarter and a decrease in the yield on loans that was greater than the decrease in the cost of deposits. Efficiency ratio increased to 51.44% for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 50.61% for the same period last year, and compared to 48.84% for the linked quarter.  This increase in the efficiency ratio was due to the compression in our net interest margin, a decrease in non-interest income, and an increase in incentive compensation related to significant loan production in the second half of the year.Return on average equity was 10.62% for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 10.95% for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 11.20% for the third quarter of 2019.Tangible book value increased to $22.80 as of the quarter ended December 31, 2019, compared to $19.84 for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $22.14 for the third quarter of 2019.The previously announced acquisition by Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., has progressed as expected and has received Federal Reserve Board approval.  The special meeting of Revere Bank stockholders is scheduled for February 11, 2020.

Fourth quarter net income increased $824 thousand ($0.06 per diluted share), or 11.4%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by increased net interest income fueled by loan growth and the FDIC small bank premium credit, partially offset by a decrease in our net interest margin and an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense, legal fees, and merger and acquisition costs.  Fourth quarter net income decreased $211 thousand ($0.02 per diluted share), or 2.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2019, due to a decrease in non-interest income, and an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, partially offset by an increase in net interest income driven by loan growth, partially offset by a 17 basis point decrease in net interest margin.

We continued to experience very strong year-over-year loan and deposit growth.  As of December 31, 2019, loans were $2.45 billion, an increase of 17.8% compared to loans of $2.08 billion as of December 31, 2018, and an increase of 3.7% compared to loans of $2.37 billion as of September 30, 2019.  Total deposits increased by 12.3% compared to $2.09 billion as of December 31, 2018, and core deposits, defined as total deposits excluding brokered deposits and listing service deposits, increased by 13.7% compared to the same period.  Total deposits increased 0.3% to $2.35 billion as of December 31, 2019, compared to $2.34 billion as of September 30, 2019.  The Bank has relied less on non-core deposits, which have decreased $21.1 million and $18.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.

On a year-over-year basis, our net interest income continues to grow and drive increased earnings.  Fourth quarter net interest income increased 10.3% compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by strong loan growth partially offset by an increase in our cost of deposits and a decrease in our yield on interest-earning assets.  Compared to the linked quarter, net interest income improved 1.9%.

Our current quarter’s net interest margin decreased 17 basis points from the linked quarter.  The decline in the margin was primarily driven by a 27 basis point decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets which was partially offset by a 15 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.  The large decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was driven by both declining interest rates charged as well as the significant cash balance, due to temporary large deposits, during the quarter which was significantly reduced by the end of the fourth quarter.  Our December 2019 net interest margin showed positive momentum leading into the first quarter of 2020.

When compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2018, our net interest margin decreased 35 basis points.  This decrease was driven by a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets and an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.  Our increased cash balance during the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease in the yield on loans caused the yield on interest-earning assets to decrease by 25 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  The 13 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates for certificates of deposit, and Federal Home Loan Bank (""FHLB"") advances, and to a lesser extent, the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities.

With the reduction of our cash balances towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, as well as a normalization of the interest rate spread, we anticipate an increase in our net interest margin during the first quarter of 2020.

Our non-interest-bearing deposits decreased 6.2% compared to the third quarter of 2019 and increased 14.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.

Provision for Loan Losses
For the fourth quarter of 2019, the provision for loan losses decreased $195 thousand compared to the third quarter of 2019 and $131 thousand compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  The provisions were impacted by net charge-offs of $112 thousand, $503 thousand, and $147 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2019, third quarter of 2019, and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.  The change in our provision also reflects slightly slower loan growth during the fourth quarter of 2019 and our superior credit quality.

Our allowance for loan losses to total loans as of December 31, 2019, was 0.94% compared to 0.90% as of December 31, 2018.  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had purchase accounting discounts, associated with our two bank acquisitions, remaining of $3.34 million and $4.33 million, respectively.  Adjusting for the remaining purchase accounting discounts, our allowance for loan losses to total loans would have been 1.07% and 1.11%, respectively.

Non-interest income was $639 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2019, a slight increase of $7 thousand, or 1.1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and a decrease of $272 thousand, or 29.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2019.  The decrease compared to the third quarter of 2019 was caused by higher loan referral fee income during the third quarter.

Non-interest expense increased by $1.36 million, or 11.8%, in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period last year.  The year-over-year increase was due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense, related to an increase in staff necessary to support our continued growth, merger and acquisition costs, occupancy expense, and legal fees for watch list loans.  Approximately $340 thousand of the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, was associated with the addition of a team of commercial lenders and support staff who joined the Bank during the second quarter of 2019.  Compared to the third quarter of 2019, non-interest expense increased $744 thousand, or 6.1%, driven by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily related to incentive compensation associated with record production in the second half of the year, and advertising expense.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, our efficiency ratio increased to 51.44% compared to 50.61% in the same period last year.  The increase was primarily due to the increase in salaries and benefits expense and merger and acquisition costs, and flat non-interest income, partially offset by the FDIC small bank premium credit.  Compared to the linked quarter, our efficiency ratio increased to 51.44% from 48.84%, driven by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a decrease in non-interest income as well as comparatively low net interest income growth.

Return on average assets decreased 11 basis points and return on average equity decreased 58 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019.  The decrease for both metrics was driven by the change in our earning asset mix resulting from a larger cash position, a decrease in the net interest margin, a decrease in non-interest income as well as an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Return on average assets and return on average equity decreased by 10 basis points and 33 basis points, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, return on average assets and equity decreased primarily due to a decrease in the net interest margin and higher salaries and employee benefits expense.  When compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the decrease in return on average equity was also impacted by the improvement in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities, which does not have an impact on earnings.

Net interest income increased $10.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $92.87 million as compared to $82.84 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase was driven by loan growth over the period and higher rates charged on loans, partially offset by a higher cost of interest-bearing liabilities.

The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased 19 basis points compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities and changes in our earning asset mix.  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 44 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher rates on certificate of deposit and money market accounts.  The increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets, driven mostly by an increase in rates charged on loans.

Provision for Loan Losses
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the provision for loan losses was $4.81 million, compared to $4.09 million for the same period last year.  The provision was impacted by our loan growth, very strong asset quality, and net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2019, of $479 thousand.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-interest income increased $606 thousand, or 27.0%, to $2.85 million compared to $2.25 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase was driven by an increase in deposit account fees, and in loan referral fee income, which is recorded in other non-interest income.

Non-interest expense increased to $47.61 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $43.95 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase of $3.66 million, or 8.3%, was primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits expense, occupancy expense, and merger and acquisition costs, partially offset by the FDIC small bank premium credits received in the third and fourth quarters of 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the efficiency ratio was 49.74% compared to 51.65% for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by strong net interest income growth, non-interest income growth and moderate non-interest expense growth over the previous twelve months.

Asset growth from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2019, was $396.0 million, or 16.1%, driven by loan growth.  Assets increased $16.0 million compared to the prior quarter, or 0.6%, due to loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in cash and due from banks.

Loans increased $370.1 million, or 17.8%, compared to December 31, 2018, and increased $88.4 million, or 3.7%, compared to September 30, 2019.  Loan increases over both periods continued to be primarily related to commercial real estate and commercial loan growth.

Deposits increased $256.4 million, or 12.3%, and increased $7.9 million, or 0.3%, compared to December 31, 2018, and September 30, 2019, respectively.  The increase compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by increases in money market, certificate of deposit and non-interest bearing accounts. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, the slight deposit increase was due to increases in money market and certificate of deposit accounts, offset by decreases in NOW and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts.

FHLB advances increased $79.9 million, or 125.9%, compared to the same period last year, and decreased $5.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to the linked quarter.  The increase compared to the prior year was due to a strategic decision to borrow from the FHLB during the first half of 2019, as rates were more favorable than running certificate of deposit specials.  During the third quarter of 2019 deposit rates normalized and FHLB borrowing rates were no longer more favorable.  We added $46.0 million and $106.0 million of new FHLB advances during the first and second quarters of 2019, respectively.  New advances were partially offset by repayments throughout the year on existing advances.

Stockholders’ equity increased $38.7 million, or 14.6%, compared to December 31, 2018.  The very strong equity growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, was primarily due to achieving record earnings for the year.  Stockholders’ equity increased by $8.4 million, or 2.8%, compared to September 30, 2019, driven by earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2019.  The increases in equity were also impacted by activity in the investment portfolio resulting in net unrealized gains of $1.1 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to net unrealized losses of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2018, and net unrealized gains of $1.4 million as of September 30, 2019.

Our capital ratios remain well above regulatory guidelines for well-capitalized banks. As of December 31, 2019, our total risk-based capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio were 13.15% and 9.48%, respectively, compared to 13.77% and 10.03%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.  As of December 31, 2019, our tangible equity to total tangible assets ratio was 9.71% compared to 9.67% as of December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, our tangible book value per share was $22.80, up 14.9% compared to $19.84 as of December 31, 2018.  The increase in tangible book value per share was due to our record earnings during 2019.

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing interest decreased $2.5 million compared to the linked quarter and increased $1.1 million compared to the same period last year. We had $112 thousand of net charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to net charge-offs of $147 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2018, and $503 thousand of net charge-offs during the third quarter of 2019.

We are proactive in monitoring our loan portfolio for any indication of weakness and attempt to mitigate future risks across all lines of business.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Statements included in this press release include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the Financial Highlights table, which provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.  This press release and the accompanying tables discuss financial measures, such as tangible common equity, tangible assets, return on tangible common equity, tangible book value per share and allowance for loan losses, adjusted, which are non-GAAP measures.  We believe that such non-GAAP measures are useful because they enhance the ability of investors and management to evaluate and compare the Bank’s operating results from period to period in a meaningful manner.  Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other banks.  Investors should consider the Bank’s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Bank.  Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Bank’s results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.

(1)Tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures.  Tangible common equity is computed as total stockholders’ equity excluding intangible assets and goodwill.  Tangible assets is computed as total assets excluding intangible assets and goodwill.  Tangible common equity to tangible assets is the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets.  Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing the total tangible common equity by the common shares issued and outstanding.  The following table provides a reconciliation of total stockholders’ equity to tangible stockholders' equity and a reconciliation of total assets to tangible assets:

(2) Efficiency ratio is non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income.
(3) Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, and other real estate owned.
(4) Allowance for loan losses, adjusted and the allowance for loan losses, adjusted to total loans are non-GAAP financial measures.  Allowance for loan losses, adjusted is calculated by adding credit marks established for acquired loans to the allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses, adjusted to total loans is calculated by dividing the allowance for loan losses, adjusted by total loans for the period.  The following table provides a reconciliation of allowance for loan losses to allowance for loan losses, adjusted:

RNGR,2020-05-06T14:32:07+00:00,Hotels eye Fed's Main Street loans as occupancy rates remain low,"American hotels are worried about foreclosing as the novel coronavirus leaves most of the country on lockdown, and franchisees of the most recognized names in accommodation are turning to the nation’s central bank for help.

With few people checking into hotels, the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) is projecting a 60% to 80% decline in revenue for the remainder of 2020. The concern: that hotels will be unable to work with their commercial mortgage servicers to make their debt payments, thus triggering a wave of defaults.

One possible lifeline: the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming Main Street Lending Program, which would offer four-year loans to large borrowers with up to $5 billion in revenue or 15,000 employees.

Wyndham Hotels and Resorts (WH) said Tuesday that its franchise network of about 9,300 hotels, including brands like the La Quinta and Super 8, could turn to the Fed’s program to weather the plunge in occupancy rates. The company said occupancy rates had fallen as low as 22%, during the week of April 11. Wyndham's occupancy levels in its U.S. economy/midscale properties fell as low as 23%. Higher-end segments dipped as low as 5%. Source: Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Investor Presentation

Rates that low are problematic for a company that estimates its breakeven point to be 30%. Still, Wyndham CEO Geoffrey Ballotti told analysts Tuesday morning that loans and programs like the Paycheck Protection Program — which provides forgivable loans to small businesses — will allow the company to survive at an even lower breakeven point.

“The passage of the Main Street Lending act could be another big support,” Ballotti said in an earnings call. “We believe our franchisees have ample liquidity and support.” MONMOUTH JUNCTION, NJ, UNITED STATES - 2018/08/14: Day's Inn in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey.

The Fed’s program was not passed through a specific act, but it will be supported by $75 billion of equity investment appropriated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Fed plans on levering up that equity into $600 billion of loans.

Wyndham franchisees have already tapped into the PPP; the company says 95% of its franchisees had already applied for a PPP or an emergency disaster loan. About 80% were actually approved for one or both loans, meaning that prolonged stress will force franchisees to turn elsewhere for help.

Story continues

The Fed’s program, however, is not yet live.

Default would be ‘disastrous’

The AHLA had warned that the PPP would not be enough, and specifically called on the Fed to create a backstop to the commercial mortgage-backed securities experiencing stress due to the wave of forbearance and other loan modifications.

In mid-April, the hotel lobby asked the Fed to set aside a $10 billion fund to take on CMBS debt payments in exchange for loans with 2% interest and a 10-year amortization schedule.

“Widespread default and foreclosure on hotel CMBS debt would be disastrous for the commercial real estate market at large as well as the holders of that debt, including pension plans and other large investors,” the AHLA wrote.

With all types of industries asking the Fed for help, the central bank expanded the scope of its Main Street Lending Program on April 30 to cover larger companies. Those loans are shorter in duration (four years) and more expensive (LIBOR plus 3%) than the terms proposed by the AHLA.

The accommodation industry is arguing that its scale makes it a critical part of the economy to save. The AHLA estimates that 70% of hotel employees have been laid off or furloughed, which is about 1.6 million people.

“We’re one of the largest industries in terms of percentage of GDP, one of the largest employers, so all of the unemployment, that’s a lot of our industry,” Hilton (HLT) CEO Christopher Nassetta told Yahoo Finance on April 25. “And so the faster we recover, the faster we put these people back to work.”

Cheesecakes and Oil

Since the Fed unveiled its Main Street program, several other industries have disclosed interest in taking a loan.

Energy companies feeling the pinch from plummeting oil prices have also expressed interest. In regulatory filings, oil rig servicer Ranger Energy (RNGR) and home heating oil distributor Star Group (SGU) both disclosed that they were exploring their eligibility.

Other companies, such as the Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and Dave & Buster’s (PLAY), have already amended credit agreements with lenders to give themselves the wiggle room to take a Fed loan if they choose to do so.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said April 29 that the Main Street facility can be adapted as needed.

“We’re going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products,” Powell said. “So, I think we'll probably be continuing to work and expand Main Street for some time.”

ROK,2021-06-30T14:39:42+00:00,Is NatWest Group plc (NWG) Going to Burn These Hedge Funds?,"We know that hedge funds generate strong, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, therefore imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors. With billions of dollars in assets, smart money investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd. This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do (like Melvin Capital's recent GameStop losses). However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity. With this in mind, as the current round of 13F filings has just ended, let’s examine the smart money sentiment towards NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG).

Is NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) the right pick for your portfolio? Hedge funds were getting more optimistic. The number of long hedge fund bets inched up by 3 in recent months. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) was in 6 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 10. Our calculations also showed that NWG isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings.

RTX,2021-06-29T07:01:00+00:00,Collins Aerospace advances zero-emission aviation with 500KW electric motor for Hybrid Air Vehicles' Airlander 10 aircraft,"SOLIHULL, U.K., June 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Collins Aerospace, a Raytheon Technologies business (NYSE: RTX), today announced it has completed critical design review and started fabrication of a 500 kilowatt electric motor for the Airlander 10 aircraft under a partnership with Hybrid Air Vehicles and the University of Nottingham.

Flight qualification testing of the motor is expected to occur in 2023, followed by hybrid-electric operation of Airlander 10 by 2025 and all-electric, zero-emission operation by 2030. To achieve these improvements, the aircraft's four fuel-burning engines will be replaced by Collins' 500 kilowatt electric motors—beginning with the two forward engines in 2025 and the two rear engines in 2030.

Collins is designing and testing the motor at its Electronic Controls and Motor Systems Center of Excellence in Solihull, U.K., where it recently invested $18 million to expand the campus and add world-class power electronics and motor development capabilities.

""Airlander 10 has the potential to be the world's first zero-emission aircraft, while pioneering game-changing electric flight technologies in the process,"" said Marc Holme, senior director, Electronic Controls and Motor Systems for Collins Aerospace. ""As the aerospace industry continues to look for ways to reduce its carbon footprint, electric propulsion offers a significant solution that will create a more sustainable future for our industry and our planet.""

The Airlander programme will address key goals of the U.K. Aerospace Technology Strategy: strengthening the UK's aerospace capabilities, positioning the UK for developing future generations of civil aircraft, and advancing a new generation of efficient propulsion technologies. The research project to develop the electric motor, E-HAV1, was co-funded by the Aerospace Technology Institute Programme, a joint U.K. government and industry investment to maintain and grow the U.K.'s competitive position in civil aerospace design and manufacture. It is delivered through a partnership between the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and Innovate U.K., and addresses technology, capability and supply chain challenges.

""The Aerospace Technology Institute has clearly identified the importance of technology developments to support sustainable aviation through the U.K. Aerospace Technology Strategy, Accelerating Ambition,"" said Mark Scully, the Aerospace Technology Institute's Head of Technology – Advanced Systems & Propulsion. ""The Hybrid Air Vehicles Airlander 10 offers a unique opportunity to deploy innovative, high performance motor technology from Collins Aerospace initially in hybrid propulsion and, in the future, all electric propulsion configurations. These technology developments will enable economic growth and jobs in the U.K. aerospace sector.""

SGC,2021-06-28T14:38:09+00:00,Superior Group of Companies (NASDAQ:SGC) Shareholders Will Want The ROCE Trajectory To Continue,"To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Superior Group of Companies (NASDAQ:SGC) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Superior Group of Companies, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.20 = US$64m ÷ (US$415m - US$91m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2021).

So, Superior Group of Companies has an ROCE of 20%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Luxury industry.

See our latest analysis for Superior Group of Companies  roce

Above you can see how the current ROCE for Superior Group of Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.

So How Is Superior Group of Companies' ROCE Trending?

Superior Group of Companies is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 20%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 101% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.

Story continues

The Bottom Line

All in all, it's terrific to see that Superior Group of Companies is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has only returned 38% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.

Superior Group of Companies does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis,and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...

First Quarter 2021 Financial Results

Total net revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 68.8% to RMB365.0 million (US$55.7 million) from RMB216.3 million in the same period of 2020. This increase was driven by the growth in paying users during the outbreak of COVID-19 on the Company's live streaming platform as well as the Company's increasing ability to attract and retain paying users and broadcasters. The number of paying users in the first quarter of 2021 was 291,949, increasing by 20.5% from 242,265 in the same period of 2020. The Company's paying ratio in the first quarter of 2021 improved to 3.44% from 1.99% in the same period of 2020.

Cost of revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 73.2% to RMB284.9 million (US$43.5 million) from RMB164.5 million in the same period of 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to a year-over-year increase of RMB103.9 million, or 74.6%, in the Company's revenue sharing fees and content costs, which was in line with the growth of the Company's live streaming operations in the first quarter of 2021.

Gross profit in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 54.7% to RMB80.1 million (US$12.2 million) from RMB51.8 million in the same period of 2020. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2021 decreased slightly to 22.0% from 24.0% in the same period of 2020, which was in line with the increase in revenue sharing fees and content costs to attract more quality broadcasters.

Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 70.8% to RMB20.0 million (US$3.0 million) from RMB11.7 million in the same period of 2020.

Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2021 decreased by 21.5% to RMB1.1 million(US$169,000) from RMB1.4 million in the same period of 2020. This decrease was mainly due to reduced promotional expenses as the Company retired its practice of promising conversion rates and shifted its marketing strategies to prioritize higher content quality in its promotional activities during the period.  General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 154.1% to RMB8.8 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB3.5 million in the same period of 2020. This increase was mainly caused by higher employee benefits, increased headcounts, as well as additional consulting and professional fees that the Company incurred as a result of its listing as a public company.  Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 50.3% to RMB9.6 million (US$1.5 million) from RMB6.4 million in the same period of 2020. This increase was due to the increases in R&D headcount and benefits to relevant employees as the Company continued to strengthen its technological capabilities.

Income from operations in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 50.0% to RMB60.2 million (US$9.2 million) from RMB40.1 million in the same period of 2020. As a result, operating margin in the first quarter of 2021 decreased to 16.5% from 18.5% in the same period of 2020.

Change in fair value of contingent consideration in the first quarter of 2021 represented a loss of RMB11.8 million (US$1.8 million). Change in fair value of contingent consideration is derived from the Company's reverse recapitalization with Wealthbridge Acquisition Limited on May 7, 2020, and acquisition of Beelive on August 10, 2020, which involved payments of future contingent consideration upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets and specific market price levels. Earn out liabilities are recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the merger date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is re-measured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized as either income or expense.

Change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the first quarter of 2021 amounted to RMB0.8 million(US$119,000). The Company's warrants assumed from SPAC acquisition that have complex terms, such as a clause in which the warrant agreements contain a cash settlement provision whereby the holders could settle the warrants for cash upon a fundamental transaction that is considered outside of the control of management are considered to be a derivative that are recorded as a liability at fair value. The warrant derivative liability is adjusted to its fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change being recorded as other expense or gain.

Change in fair value of investment in marketable security in the first quarter of 2021 amounted to RMB26.2 million (US$4.0 million). In January 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Scienjoy Inc., purchased from Cross Wealth Investment Holding Limited, an entity related to two directors of the Company, 606,061 ordinary shares of Goldenbridge Acquisition Limited (""Goldenbridge"") for an aggregated consideration of US$2 million. Goldenbridge was formed as a special purpose acquisition company. The investment was classified as investment in marketable security, which is adjusted to its fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change being recorded as other expense or gain.

Net income in the first quarter of 2021 increased by 88.4% to RMB71.0 million (US$10.8 million) from RMB37.7 million in the same period of 2020. Net margin in the first quarter of 2021 expanded to 19.4% from 17.4% in the same period of 2020.

Adjusted net income in the first quarter of 2021, which excludes changes in fair value of contingent consideration and change in fair value of warrants liability, increased by 121.8% to RMB83.5 million (US$12.7 million) from RMB37.7 million in the same period of 2020. As a result, adjusted net margin in the first quarter of 2021 further improved to 22.9% from 17.4% in the same period of 2020.

Basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in the first quarter of 2021 were both RMB2.32(US$0.35). In comparison, basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in the same period of 2020 were RMB1.94 and RMB1.88, respectively.

Adjusted basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in the first quarter of 2021 were both RMB2.73(US$0.42). In comparison, adjusted basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in the same period of 2020 were RMB1.94 and RMB1.88, respectively.

Business Outlook

The Company expects its total net revenues to be in the range of RMB356 million to RMB374 million in the second quarter of 2021. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change, particularly in respect to the potential impact of COVID-19 on the economy in China and other markets around the world.

Recent Developments

On April 19, 2021, the Company announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Jiada Hexin (Beijing) Science and Technology Ltd., an online-to-offline (O2O) aesthetic medicine platform.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted net income is calculated as net income adjusted for change in fair value of contingent consideration and warrant liabilities. Adjusted basic and diluted net income per ordinary share is non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ordinary share. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. As non-GAAP financial measures have material limitations as analytical metrics and may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measures as a substitute for, or superior to, such metrics in accordance with US GAAP.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned ""Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results"" near the end of this release.

SKIL,2021-06-21T21:32:00+00:00,"Skillsoft Launches Debt Refinancing and Comments on Combined Results for the Quarter Ended April 30, 2021","Refinancing Expected to Further Enhance Financial Flexibility by Reducing Interest Expense & Increasing Free Cash Flow

Q1 Results Exceed Internal Plan, with Strong Performance in Core Content Business; Company Remains on Track to Meet Fiscal 2022 Guidance

BOSTON, Jun 21, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Skillsoft Corp. (NYSE: SKIL) (""Skillsoft"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in corporate digital learning, today announced it has launched marketing for a refinancing of a substantial amount of its long-term debt while repaying the remainder, which is expected to meaningfully decrease the Company’s interest expense, increase free cash flow, increase financial flexibility to grow through acquisitions, and significantly extend the maturity of any obligations. Skillsoft also noted that its Board of Directors has approved the adoption of a January 31 year-end for the Company’s financial reporting, effective immediately, to align Churchill Capital Corp II and Global Knowledge with the pre-business combination Skillsoft’s fiscal year end. In addition, Skillsoft commented on financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021, reflecting the Company’s recent combinations with Churchill Capital Corp II and Global Knowledge as if the combined company had a fiscal quarter end of April 30, 2021.

""I am pleased to report that our fiscal year is off to a strong start, with results exceeding our internal plan,"" said Jeffrey R. Tarr, Skillsoft’s Chief Executive Officer. ""I’m especially encouraged that order intake for the Skillsoft Content Business combined with Global Knowledge grew by 9% in the quarter ended April 30, 2021. While it’s still early in the fiscal year and in our journey as the new Skillsoft, the momentum we are seeing reinforces my confidence in our ability to meet our full year fiscal 2022 guidance and create significant long-term shareholder value as we integrate the two businesses, realize synergies and complete the migration to Percipio.""

Story continues

Skillsoft noted that continued growth in Percipio drove improvement in dollar retention rate during the fiscal first quarter. In addition, the Company has recently built a dedicated customer acquisition team with more than 30 experienced sellers, and expects to complete the integration of the Global Knowledge sales organization with the Skillsoft Technology & Development specialized salesforces over the coming months, consistent with its integration plan.

Mr. Tarr continued, ""Skillsoft has a strong capital structure and the strategic refinancing is a proactive step that will enable us to increase our financial flexibility as we execute on attractive growth opportunities, and help our customers build a future-fit workforce, skilled and ready for the jobs of tomorrow.""

Terms of the potential refinancing will be disclosed upon the completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur in July 2021. The proposed refinancing is subject to market and other conditions and the approval of the Skillsoft Board of Directors, and there can be no assurance that it will be completed on favorable terms or at all.

Additional information is available in Skillsoft’s pre-business combination actual financial results for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021, included in its Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") filed on June 17, 2021, and in Global Knowledge’s actual financial results for the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2021, as reported in Skillsoft’s amended Form S-4 filed with the SEC on May 27, 2021 and updated herein to align with pre-combination Skillsoft’s fiscal first quarter.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS

We track several non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics that we believe are key financial measures of our success. Non-GAAP measures and key performance metrics are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us, many of which present non-GAAP measures and key performance metrics when reporting their results. These measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of U.S. GAAP financial disclosures. For example, a company with higher U.S. GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if its net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, excluding the effects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company’s capital structure on its performance. However, non-GAAP measures and key performance metrics have limitations as analytical tools. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. They are not presentations made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not measures of financial condition or liquidity, and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We do not reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is available to us without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. We provide non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will be achieved, however we cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures.

Forward Looking Statements

This document includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by those laws. These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of our operations. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future, including such things as our outlook, our product development and planning, our pipeline, future capital expenditures, financial results, the impact of regulatory changes, existing and evolving business strategies and acquisitions and dispositions, demand for our services and competitive strengths, goals, the benefits of new initiatives, growth of our business and operations, our ability to successfully implement our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions are forward-looking statements. Also, when we use words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""projects,"" ""forecasts,"" ""seeks,"" ""outlook,"" ""target,"" goals,"" ""probably,"" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Skillsoft’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking disclosure is speculative by its nature.

There are important risks, uncertainties, events and factors that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained in this document, including:

our ability to realize the benefits expected from the business combination; our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us; the impact of changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer preferences, local, regional and national economic conditions, crime, weather, demographic trends and employee availability; the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results and financial condition; fluctuations in our future operating results; our ability to successfully identify and consummate acquisition opportunities; the demand for, and acceptance of, our products and for cloud-based technology learning solutions in general; our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets and changes in the competitive environment in our industry and the markets in which we operate; our ability to market existing products and develop new products; a failure of our information technology infrastructure or any significant breach of security; the effects of pending and future legislation; future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes in our industry; the impact of natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events; our ability to attract and retain key employees and qualified technical and sales personnel; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to protect or obtain intellectual property rights; our ability to raise additional capital; the impact of our indebtedness on our financial position and operating flexibility; and our ability to successfully defend ourselves in legal proceedings.

The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive and new factors may emerge from time to time that could also affect actual performance and results. For more information, please see the risk factors included in Churchill Capital Corp. II’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020 in Part I, Item 1A and in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by Churchill Capital Corp. II and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on May 27, 2021, and subsequent filings with the SEC.

Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions, and therefore also the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions, could themselves prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this document, our inclusion of this information is not a representation or guarantee by us that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and we will not update these forward-looking statements unless required by applicable law. With regard to these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this document may not occur, and we caution you against unduly relying on these forward-looking statements.

SLNG,2021-06-01T20:58:00+00:00,"Stabilis Solutions Acquires LNG Production Facility in Port Allen, Louisiana","Houston, Tx, June  01, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stabilis Solutions, Inc., (""Stabilis"") (NASDAQ: SLNG), a leading provider of energy transition services including liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and hydrogen fueling solutions, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of an LNG production facility in Port Allen, Louisiana from HR Nu Blu Energy, LLC.   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

The Port Allen facility is strategically located in the eastern Gulf Coast region and will support some of Stabilis’ largest customers.  Built in 2018, the facility has nameplate production capacity of 30,000 LNG gallons per day which increases Stabilis’ total nameplate production capacity by approximately 30%.  Stabilis believes that it will be able to sell all of the facility’s capacity immediately with contracts from existing customers.

“We are excited with the opportunities presented by the Port Allen acquisition,” commented Jim Reddinger, President and CEO of Stabilis.  ”The facility’s location is ideal to meet the growing clean energy needs of our customers in the Gulf Coast region.  In addition, it currently supports North America’s largest LNG-powered offshore service vessel fleet located in Port Fourchon, Louisiana. We are witnessing rapid expansion in LNG marine bunkering activity across North America, and this acquisition allows us to expand our LNG marine bunkering services to customers throughout the Gulf Coast, including the ports of Baton Rouge, New Orleans and beyond.”

Stabilis projects that the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings.  Incremental annual EBITDA is projected to be $2.5 - $3.0 million.

Reddinger added, “The incremental cash flow that this acquisition creates demonstrates the tremendous operating leverage that exists in the Stabilis platform.  We believe that additional opportunities exist to acquire LNG production facilities that expand our footprint across North America.”

About Stabilis
Stabilis Solutions, Inc. is a vertically integrated energy transition company that provides clean energy solutions to our customers. Our solutions include small-scale liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) production, distribution and fueling services to multiple end markets in North America. Stabilis also provides hydrogen fueling services to its customers. Stabilis has safely delivered over 250 million gallons of LNG through more than 25,000 truck deliveries during its 16-year operating history in the LNG industry, which we believe makes us one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. Stabilis’ customers use LNG and hydrogen as fuel sources in a variety of applications in the industrial, energy, mining, utilities and pipelines, commercial, and high horsepower transportation markets. Stabilis’ customers use LNG and hydrogen as alternatives to traditional fuel sources, such as distillate fuel oil and propane, to lower fuel costs and reduce harmful environmental emissions. Stabilis’ customers also use LNG as a “virtual pipeline” solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or volumes are curtailed. To learn more, visit www.stabilis-solutions.com.

SO,2021-06-30T15:49:00+00:00,"Georgia Power Foundation announces $500,000 investment in Georgia Justice Project initiative","Effort supporting new law and reforms is part of five-year, $75-million commitment

ATLANTA, June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Georgia Power today announced an investment of $500,000 by the Georgia Power Foundation, to the Georgia Justice Project (GJP). The funding will help remove barriers to employment and housing and open other opportunities for those with past records who are working to be productive citizens. Georgia Power logo. (PRNewsFoto/Georgia Power)

""We are proud to support this initiative that will help citizens working hard to be self-sufficient,"" said Mike Anderson, senior vice president of Georgia Power and president and CEO of the Georgia Power Foundation. ""Our commitment to this important work and GJP's efforts, are critical because this is one way that we can make a real impact to help both individuals and our state. As part of our $75 million commitment over the next five-years, it aligns with our goals to assist with education equity, criminal justice and economic empowerment.""

The efforts support expanding direct service programs, including implementation of Georgia's new ""expungement law,"" SB 288, that passed both the Georgia House and Senate unanimously. This new law expands access to criminal record restriction and sealing to help clear obstacles to success for approximately 1.5 million Georgians who now have access to record restriction for the first time. Georgia Power's grant will support GJP's efforts to implement a multipronged campaign that includes direct service, education and outreach, and policy expansion to increase the effectiveness of the new law.

""This grant will help Georgia Justice Project ensure effective implementation of Georgia's newly expanded criminal records law by bringing services directly to communities,"" said Brenda Smeeton, Legal Director of Georgia Justice Project. ""As of January this year, many rehabilitated Georgians are now eligible to seal a conviction history to remove barriers to employment, housing and other opportunities, but a new law is only effective if the people who need it most can access it, and this grant will allow us to host expungement desks and events around the state. Our sincere gratitude to Georgia Power for supporting this effort.""

Story continues

For 35 years, GJP has served Georgians who have been impacted by the criminal legal system. The organization's range of legal services includes holistic criminal defense paired with social services, as well as representation for criminal records issues, all provided free of charge. GJP works statewide to educate individuals and service providers on criminal records, issues, and has helped to pass 21 Georgia laws through advocacy efforts.

STAA,2021-06-30T16:00:04+00:00,What Makes Staar Surgical (STAA) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.

Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.

Below, we take a look at Staar Surgical (STAA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.

It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Staar Surgical currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.

You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>

Set to Beat the Market?

Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for STAA that show why this maker of implantable lenses shows promise as a solid momentum pick.

Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.

Story continues

For STAA, shares are up 5.02% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry is up 2.2% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.94% compares favorably with the industry's 3.42% performance as well.

Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Staar Surgical have risen 35.45%, and are up 147.81% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 8.44% and 42.38%, respectively.

Investors should also take note of STAA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, STAA is averaging 398,826 shares for the last 20 days.

Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with STAA.

Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost STAA's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.35 to $0.49 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that STAA is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Staar Surgical on your short list.

SWKS,2021-06-30T21:45:09+00:00,Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know,"In the latest trading session, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) closed at $191.75, marking a +0.42% move from the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.13% gain on the day.

Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 12.07% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.68% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.16% in that time.

SWKS will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect SWKS to post earnings of $2.13 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 70.4%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.1 billion, up 49.42% from the prior-year quarter.

SWKS's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.30 per share and revenue of $5 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +68.03% and +48.91%, respectively.

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for SWKS. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. SWKS currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

Valuation is also important, so investors should note that SWKS has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.54 right now. This represents a no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.54.

Story continues

It is also worth noting that SWKS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.01. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. SWKS's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.32 as of yesterday's close.

The Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 200, putting it in the bottom 22% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

TFX,2021-06-28T21:00:00+00:00,Teleflex Completes Divestiture of Respiratory Assets to Medline Industries,"WAYNE, Pa., June  28, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Teleflex Incorporated (NYSE:TFX), a leading global provider for healthcare supplies and services, announced it has completed the previously announced divestiture of a significant portion of its Respiratory business to Medline Industries, Inc. (“Medline”) for $286 million in cash, reduced by $12 million in working capital not transferring to Medline.

The divested Teleflex respiratory product lines include Hudson RCI® products for oxygen and aerosol therapy, active humidification, non-invasive ventilation, and incentive spirometers, all of which generated $139 million in revenue in 2020. In 2021, the divested respiratory product lines were expected to contribute net revenue approximately flat with the $139 million in 2020.

Based on the date of closing, the company estimates a revenue headwind of $28-$32 million and adjusted earnings per share dilution of $0.10-$0.15 in 2021 or approximately 1% of 2021 adjusted earnings per share, net of a manufacturing services agreement that Teleflex has entered into with Medline as of the initial closing of the sale transaction. Teleflex intends to use the proceeds from the divestiture to pay down debt, augmenting its financial flexibility to support its growth strategy.

TRN,2021-06-23T16:40:36+00:00,Hedge Funds Have Never Been This Bullish On Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (OUT),"Our extensive research has shown that imitating the smart money can generate significant returns for retail investors, which is why we track nearly 900 active prominent money managers and analyze their quarterly 13F filings. The stocks that are heavily bought by hedge funds historically outperformed the market, though there is no shortage of high profile failures like hedge funds' 2018 losses in Facebook and Apple. Let’s take a closer look at what the funds we track think about Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT) in this article.

Is Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT) the right pick for your portfolio? Money managers were in a bullish mood. The number of bullish hedge fund bets increased by 3 recently. Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT) was in 41 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic was previously 38. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that OUT isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

In today’s marketplace there are numerous formulas market participants employ to analyze publicly traded companies. A duo of the most innovative formulas are hedge fund and insider trading sentiment. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the elite fund managers can trounce the S&P 500 by a very impressive amount (see the details here). Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points.

At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, Federal Reserve has been creating trillions of dollars electronically to keep the interest rates near zero. We believe this will lead to inflation, which is why we are checking out this inflation play. We go through lists like 10 best gold stocks to buy to identify promising stocks. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. With all of this in mind we're going to take a glance at the recent hedge fund action encompassing Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT).

Do Hedge Funds Think OUT Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At Q1's end, a total of 41 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 8% from the previous quarter. By comparison, 30 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in OUT a year ago. With hedge funds' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a select group of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were increasing their stakes considerably (or already accumulated large positions).

More specifically, Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder of Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT), with a stake worth $95.8 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Citadel Investment Group was Fir Tree, which amassed a stake valued at $68.9 million. Rima Senvest Management, EMS Capital, and P2 Capital Partners were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Hidden Lake Asset Management allocated the biggest weight to Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT), around 6.95% of its 13F portfolio. Land & Buildings Investment Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 5.48 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to OUT.

As industrywide interest jumped, some big names were leading the bulls' herd. Anomaly Capital Management, managed by Ben Jacobs, created the largest position in Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT). Anomaly Capital Management had $28.7 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Dmitry Balyasny's Balyasny Asset Management also made a $20.8 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with new positions in the stock are David Brown's Hawk Ridge Management, Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson's Adage Capital Management, and Peter S. Park's Park West Asset Management.

Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT) but similarly valued. These stocks are Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE:WWW), Trinity Industries, Inc. (NYSE:TRN), Empire State Realty OP, L.P. (NYSE:ESBA), Cohen & Steers, Inc. (NYSE:CNS), Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. (NYSE:AQUA), United States Cellular Corporation (NYSE:USM), and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ:SFM). This group of stocks' market caps are similar to OUT's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 16.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $289 million. That figure was $746 million in OUT's case. Trinity Industries, Inc. (NYSE:TRN) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Empire State Realty OP, L.P. (NYSE:ESBA) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Outfront Media Inc. (REIT) (NYSE:OUT) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for OUT is 88. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.4% in 2021 through June 18th and still managed to beat the market by 6.1 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on OUT, though not to the same extent, as the stock returned 8% since the end of March (through June 18th) and outperformed the market as well.

TSBK,2021-06-28T18:01:19+00:00,"Where Do Hedge Funds Stand On Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (TSBK)?","The latest 13F reporting period has come and gone, and Insider Monkey is again at the forefront when it comes to making use of this gold mine of data. We have processed the filings of the more than 866 world-class investment firms that we track and now have access to the collective wisdom contained in these filings, which are based on their March 31st holdings, data that is available nowhere else. Should you consider Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK) for your portfolio? We'll look to this invaluable collective wisdom for the answer.

Hedge fund interest in Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK) shares was flat at the end of last quarter. This is usually a negative indicator. Our calculations also showed that TSBK isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). At the end of this article we will also compare TSBK to other stocks including Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXSQ), MDC Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:MDCA), and SC Health Corporation (NYSE:SCPE) to get a better sense of its popularity.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

At Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, an activist hedge fund owns nearly 40% of this $24 biotech stock and is trying to buy the rest for around $50. So, we recommended a long position to our monthly premium newsletter subscribers. We go through lists like the 10 best battery stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind let's review the latest hedge fund action regarding Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK).

Do Hedge Funds Think TSBK Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

Heading into the second quarter of 2021, a total of 6 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 0% from the previous quarter. By comparison, 3 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in TSBK a year ago. With hedgies' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists a few notable hedge fund managers who were adding to their holdings meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions). Is TSBK A Good Stock To Buy?

Among these funds, Royce & Associates held the most valuable stake in Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK), which was worth $16.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was Renaissance Technologies which amassed $10.4 million worth of shares. Basswood Capital, Fourthstone LLC, and Bailard Inc were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Fourthstone LLC allocated the biggest weight to Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK), around 0.2% of its 13F portfolio. Basswood Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 0.15 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to TSBK.

We view hedge fund activity in the stock unfavorable, but in this case there was only a single hedge fund selling its entire position: Zebra Capital Management. One hedge fund selling its entire position doesn't always imply a bearish intent. Theoretically a hedge fund may decide to sell a promising position in order to invest the proceeds in a more promising idea. However, we don't think this is the case in this case because only one of the 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey identified as a viable investment and initiated a position in the stock (that fund was Arrowstreet Capital).

Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK). We will take a look at Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXSQ), MDC Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:MDCA), SC Health Corporation (NYSE:SCPE), Sanara MedTech Inc. (NASDAQ:SMTI), Ring Energy Inc (NYSE:REI), Unity Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNTY), and Gaia, Inc. (NASDAQ:GAIA). This group of stocks' market caps match TSBK's market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 8.4 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $26 million. That figure was $31 million in TSBK's case. SC Health Corporation (NYSE:SCPE) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Unity Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNTY) is the least popular one with only 4 bullish hedge fund positions. Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSBK) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for TSBK is 42.7. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 19.3% in 2021 through June 25th and surpassed the market again by 4.8 percentage points. Unfortunately TSBK wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); TSBK investors were disappointed as the stock returned 4.8% since the end of March (through 6/25) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

TSE,2021-06-29T12:43:16+00:00,"Hedge Funds Are Buying Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (ASO)","We know that hedge funds generate strong, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, therefore imitating the picks that they are collectively bullish on can be a profitable strategy for retail investors. With billions of dollars in assets, smart money investors have to conduct complex analyses, spend many resources and use tools that are not always available for the general crowd. This doesn't mean that they don't have occasional colossal losses; they do (like Melvin Capital's recent GameStop losses). However, it is still a good idea to keep an eye on hedge fund activity. With this in mind, as the current round of 13F filings has just ended, let’s examine the smart money sentiment towards Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO).

Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO) has seen an increase in hedge fund interest recently. Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO) was in 37 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic was previously 26. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that ASO isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

According to most stock holders, hedge funds are assumed to be underperforming, outdated financial vehicles of the past. While there are greater than 8000 funds trading at the moment, Our researchers choose to focus on the aristocrats of this club, about 850 funds. It is estimated that this group of investors preside over the majority of all hedge funds' total asset base, and by paying attention to their highest performing investments, Insider Monkey has formulated numerous investment strategies that have historically surpassed Mr. Market. Insider Monkey's flagship short hedge fund strategy outstripped the S&P 500 short ETFs by around 20 percentage points annually since its inception in March 2017. Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:ASO), around 2.78% of its 13F portfolio. Six Columns Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 2.4 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ASO.

As aggregate interest increased, some big names have jumped into Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO) headfirst. Park West Asset Management, managed by Peter S. Park, established the biggest position in Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO). Park West Asset Management had $18.9 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Joseph Samuels's Islet Management also made a $14.8 million investment in the stock during the quarter.

Compared to these stocks Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASO) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for ASO is 90.

Hedge funds were clearly right about piling into this stock relative to other stocks with similar market capitalizations.

The new joint partnership between Denver-based Frontier Airlines (NASDAQ: ULCC), which prides itself on offering ‘Low Fares Done Right’ and leading home meal kit delivery company, Home Chef, has been enabled by global leader in loyalty commerce, Points, (TSX: PTS) (NASDAQ: PCOM).

""With a continued focus on adding value and improving the FRONTIER Miles program, Frontier is excited to add Home Chef as a partner that will make earning miles even easier while increasing the value of membership for our customers,” said Tommy Langhauser, senior manager of loyalty and co-brand, Frontier Airlines. “Home Chef and Frontier are a natural fit as both appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and families who seek value in their travel and dining experiences.""

Points delivers best-in-class loyalty solutions to close to 60 of the world’s largest loyalty programs and first began working with Home Chef in 2019. Since then the two companies have implemented several integrations linking members from a number of Points’ loyalty program partners within the travel, hospitality and finance sectors with the leading home meal kit delivery company. Frontier will be the third North American airline to take advantage of this partnership agreement that is enabled through Points’ loyalty commerce platform.

""We're thrilled to expand our partnership with Points and announce the launch of our program with Frontier Airlines,"" said Erik Jensen, President of Home Chef. ""Home Chef is dedicated to bringing people together through experiences, and we're excited to offer our fans the opportunity to earn FRONTIER Miles with their meal kit orders. It not only allows them to gather around a home-cooked meal but also provides the chance to kick start their travel plans.""

Extending travel loyalty program member benefits to encompass opportunities to earn points on everyday purchases like meal kit delivery has been a trend that has been growing in popularity over the past 12 months. Diversifying the ways in which members can earn their Miles offers brands a valuable way to engage with their most loyal customers as well as drive incremental revenue.

Rob MacLean, CEO of Points, also commented: “We are delighted to be strengthening our collaboration with Home Chef once more and to be connecting them with our longstanding partner, Frontier Airlines. Providing members with multiple ways to earn points/miles is a priority among many travel brands.

VECO,2021-06-29T14:32:04+00:00,Here's Why Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ:VECO) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Veeco Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

When Is Debt Dangerous?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

View our latest analysis for Veeco Instruments

How Much Debt Does Veeco Instruments Carry?

The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2021 Veeco Instruments had debt of US$324.6m, up from US$303.4m in one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$326.9m in cash, so it actually has US$2.25m net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis

How Strong Is Veeco Instruments' Balance Sheet?

The latest balance sheet data shows that Veeco Instruments had liabilities of US$163.7m due within a year, and liabilities of US$369.1m falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$326.9m in cash and US$108.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$97.9m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Given Veeco Instruments has a market capitalization of US$1.22b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Veeco Instruments also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.

Story continues

Notably, Veeco Instruments made a loss at the EBIT level, last year, but improved that to positive EBIT of US$28m in the last twelve months. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Veeco Instruments can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Veeco Instruments may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Happily for any shareholders, Veeco Instruments actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last year. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.

Summing up

While it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Veeco Instruments has US$2.25m in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 171% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$48m. So we don't have any problem with Veeco Instruments's use of debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Veeco Instruments has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.

VMEO,2021-06-22T08:07:31+00:00,Vimeo Stock: Can It Stream Profits for Investors?,"Vimeo (VMEO), which operates an online video platform, came public last month through a spin-off from IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC). Unfortunately, the deal has not been so great. Note that the shares have gone from a high of $57 to $43. The market capitalization is roughly $7 billion.

Yet it is not uncommon for spin-offs to get hit with plenty of selling. The valuation can be tough to gauge on these offerings. Furthermore, the shareholder base of the parent company may not necessarily want to hold shares in the newly public company.

Now, IAC is certainly no stranger to spin-offs. The company is actually one of the most prolific dealmakers in Corporate America. IAC has engineered 11 spin-offs, such as for Expedia (EXPE), Match Group (MTCH) and LendingTree (TREE). As for Vimeo, this is definitely one to keep an eye on. (See Vimeo stock chart on TipRanks)

Background

Vimeo got its start back in late 2004 (the company’s name is a blend of “video” and “me”). The founders included two programmers, Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein. They had created several other websites, including CollegeHumor, that were part of an organization called Connected Ventures.

A couple years later, IAC acquired the company. Interestingly enough, the main driver for the acquisition was CollegeHumor. But ultimately, Vimeo wound up being the real gem.

Fast forward to today: the company is a powerhouse in the online video industry. Consider that Vimeo has over 200 million users.

The app makes it much easier for anyone to create and distribute professional quality videos. Just some of the features include a sophisticated editing system, stock footage, screen recordings, and templates.

Growth has definitely been robust. In the latest quarter, revenues spiked by 57% to $89.4 million and the net profit came to $3.3 million, compared to a net loss of $20.3 million in the same period a year ago. The company has about $316 million in the bank.

Vimeo generates revenues based on a freemium model. What’s more, although the users are primarily small and medium size businesses (SMBs), Vimeo has been getting more traction with enterprise customers. That has helped to boost its top line.

Story continues

The market opportunity is quite large as well. On a global basis, there are over 300 million SMBs and more than one million enterprises.

According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, the addressable market is estimated at a whopping $70 billion. Moreover, he is highly positive about Vimeo, saying, “From live event streaming to workforce training, business adoption of video is gaining momentum, and we believe Vimeo’s best-in-class platform can become the leading one-stop-shop enterprise solution.”

Wall Street’s Take

Turning to the analyst community, Vimeo stock has 4 Buys and 1 Hold that have been assigned in the past three months. So, the shares are a Strong Buy. At $53, the average analyst Vimeo price target implies 22% upside potential.

Bottom Line On Vimeo Stock

No doubt, online video is a secular tailwind. This technology is rapidly becoming essential for the success of businesses – and yes, Vimeo has a strong solution.

But the company still has only about 1.6 million subscribers. In other words, there is much room for monetizing the base, which should help provide for solid long-term growth.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Walmart de Mexico said on Wednesday it would allow older people to return to its stores as grocery packers, after they were removed in March 2020 amid concerns about the workers' vulnerability to COVID-19.

Some 35,000 Mexicans, most aged between 60 and 74, packed groceries at Walmart's stores and other chains in Mexico through a government-backed volunteer program, earning just tips, before the pandemic.

After pressure from workers, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said last week that he would speak to the retailer about a reported decision to not allow them to return.

""Where the epidemiological traffic light is green, older adults who already have their full COVID-19 vaccination schedule are allowed to resume their work as volunteer packers,"" the retailer said in a statement.

Most hedge fund investors experienced strong gains on the back of a strong market performance, which certainly propelled them to adjust their equity holdings so as to maintain the desired risk profile.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings.
