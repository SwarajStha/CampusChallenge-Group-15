AIN,2021-06-09T05:24:33+00:00,Is Albany International Corp.'s (NYSE:AIN) Recent Performance Tethered To Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,"Most readers would already know that Albany International's (NYSE:AIN) stock increased by 3.1% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Albany International's  ROE today.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

Check out our latest analysis for Albany International

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Albany International is:

14% = US$117m ÷ US$826m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2021).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.14 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

A Side By Side comparison of Albany International's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE

At first glance, Albany International seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. This probably laid the ground for Albany International's moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.

Story continues

We then compared Albany International's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.8% in the same period. past-earnings-growth

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Albany International is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.

Is Albany International Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Albany International's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 22% (implying that it retains 78% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.

Moreover, Albany International is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Albany International's future ROE will be 13% which is again, similar to the current ROE.

Summary

On the whole, we feel that Albany International's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

AIV,2021-06-28T20:24:35+00:00,The company Tesla booted from the S&amp;P 500 is outperforming it,"The company Tesla (TSLA) booted from the S&P 500 index has vastly outperformed the electric automaker by a “stupendous margin,” analysts at Research Affiliates pointed out this week.

Tesla entered the S&P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe.

Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&P 500 does not become the S&P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot.

According to analysis from Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott, Vitali Kalesnik, and Lillian Wu, Apartment Investment and Management, this pattern is not uncommon. Frequently, additions to the index underperform and removed companies often do very well, the authors wrote in a research note.

""Traditional cap-weighted indices routinely buy high and sell low when the index rebalances resulting in substantial hidden costs to investors who track the index,” the note said. “The December 2020 S&P 500 rebalance out of AIV and into TSLA cost investors 41 [basis points] in the first six months, and the cost may go higher.”

In their view, a struggling stock getting kicked out of the index during a rebalancing means getting the axe at a low point. On the other side, a hot new stock getting added to the index is trading at a high point. TSLA vs AIV with the S&P 500 for context. (Yahoo Finance)

The authors pointed out that though index investing is passive, the actual indexes aren’t necessarily passive as the decisions on which companies to include in the S&P 500 is controlled by a committee. And the index changes to compensate for companies’ valuations and new entrants periodically, not automatically.

Story continues

An investor who had $100,000 in, say, an S&P 500 index fund on Dec. 21 when the rebalancing happened would be $410 poorer had no rebalance happened, Research Affiliates calculated.

""Unfortunately, this cost is totally unnoticed by investors because it is baked into the index’s performance,” the authors wrote.

The analysis suggests these are hidden costs of indexing and Tesla’s underperformance and Apartment Investment and Management’s outperformance should have come as no surprise given historical patterns. But of course, there was no guarantee this time was going to be like the previous ones.

But if you think this pattern could be a consistent one, the paper’s authors believe there’s an opportunity to innovate.

“Smarter index design and more efficient implementation could help investors tracking traditional indices avoid these hidden costs,” they wrote.

That may not happen, so they propose another option: If you’re not just an index fund buyer, try doing the opposite of what the index does.

“The index rebalance is a great opportunity to do the opposite of what the index does: buy the deletion and sell the addition,” the authors wrote. “Providing index investors liquidity and benefitting from the mean reversion of the price changes has historically proven to be an excellent investment idea.”

ALF,2021-06-23T09:45:10+00:00,"Alfi Inc shares set to fall from record highs, 'meme stock' Torchlight sinks","(Reuters) -Shares of software firm Alfi Inc fell 10% in early deals on Wednesday after more than doubling in value in the previous session, in a move evocative of the so-called ""meme stock"" frenzy that has gripped equity markets this year.

Alfi's stock was trading at around $14.65 per share by 5:26 a.m. ET after ending Tuesday's session at a record high of $16.29, and was again among the most heavily traded stocks before the bell.

Some social media users and one portfolio manager on Tuesday cited a Benzinga.com report that Alfi planned to buy back stock as helping to fuel the rally.

Shares of a group of heavily shorted companies including video game retailer GameStop Corp and cinema operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc have seen wild swings this year in a phenomenon dubbed the ""meme stock"" rally that has been driven by small-time traders on online discussion forums.

Although short interest in Alfi last stood at 3.85% of free float, according to Refinitiv data, the company was among the top 10 trending stocks on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits, a platform commonly seen as a measure of interest from retail investors.

Another retail darling, Torchlight Energy Resources Inc, sank 10% in premarket trading, extending a 30% slide in the previous session after it upsized its stock offering to $250 million.

GameStop has also cashed in on the Reddit-driven rally in its stock, saying on Tuesday it had raised $1.13 billion in its latest share offering. Its shares were down 0.3% after jumping 10% in the previous session.

AMC shares slid 0.8%, while other meme stocks Clover Health Investments Corp, ContextLogic Inc and Petco Health and Wellness Co rose between 0.4% and 2.4%.

ALKS,2021-06-30T11:00:00+00:00,Alkermes Presented New Data Analysis on Healthcare Resource Use Among Veterans With Alcohol Dependence,"- Retrospective Study of Veterans Health Administration Data Showed an Association Between VIVITROL Treatment and Reduced Emergency Department Visits and Inpatient Hospital Stays -

DUBLIN, June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Alkermes plc (Nasdaq: ALKS) today announced the presentation of new health economics and outcomes research related to healthcare resource use (HRU) among veterans with alcohol dependence at the 2021 Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) Scientific Meeting/International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) Conference, which took place virtually June 19-23, 2021.

The company presented results from a retrospective, observational study using data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) database, which includes healthcare encounters, treatments and laboratory tests at VHA facilities. The study assessed treatment patterns and HRU among 3,665 patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence who were treated with VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension (XR-NTX)).

In the study, VIVITROL treatment for alcohol dependence was associated with decreases in inpatient care and increases in outpatient care during the one-year period following initiation of treatment with VIVITROL, compared to the one-year period before VIVITROL treatment initiation. Specifically:

During the baseline period, defined as the one year before VIVITROL initiation, 61.5 percent of patients had at least one inpatient admission, and 39.8 percent of patients had an emergency department visit. During the follow up period, defined as one year after VIVITROL initiation, 37.8 percent of patients had at least one inpatient admission and 35.4 percent of patients had an emergency department visit.

These HRU changes may reflect a possible transition to less resource-intensive care for veterans initiating VIVITROL. The generalizability of these results to the U.S. population may be limited.

""Alkermes is committed to advancing research on substance use disorders and veterans represent an important demographic given the pervasiveness of alcohol dependence and the broad unmet medical need within the veteran community,"" said Amy O'Sullivan, Vice President, Health Economics & Outcomes Research. ""Though more research is needed, the VHA dataset provides insight into how the use of VIVITROL may impact engagement in treatment, healthcare resource utilization, and health outcomes in this patient population.""

Details of the poster presentation at RSA are as follows:

Poster #240: Treatment Patterns and Healthcare Resource Use Among Patients with Alcohol Dependence who Initiated Extended-Release Naltrexone: An Analysis of Veterans Affairs Data, was presented Sunday, June 20.

Alkermes previously presented data from another retrospective, observational study using the same VHA database at the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS), The Society of Federal Health Professionals, Annual Meeting in December 2020. That study was one of the first studies to provide insights into the patient journey among veterans from alcohol dependence diagnosis to VIVITROL initiation and beyond. Patients studied had extensive health care use and carried a high burden of chronic disease, including hypertension (40.5 percent), chronic pain (10.8 percent), and diabetes (9.7 percent). In addition, a majority had diagnoses for mental health comorbidities, such as depression (74.1 percent), non-alcohol/opioid substance use disorder (66.3 percent), and post-traumatic stress syndrome (52.9 percent). Key findings included:

Although 25 percent of patients initiated VIVITROL within 60 days of diagnosis, the average time from initial diagnosis to VIVITROL initiation was analogous to 13.6 months. While many of the patients studied (75.8 percent) received oral naltrexone prior to initiating VIVITROL, 22.0 percent initiated VIVITROL as first-line medication. Additionally, about half of the patients studied (46.6 percent) did not initiate other alcohol dependence medications during the study period following initiation of treatment with VIVITROL.

About Alcohol Dependence Alcohol dependence is a chronic, relapsing disease that poses serious and potentially fatal health risks.1 In 2017, it affected nearly 8 million people aged 12 and older in the U.S., with a significant burden on veterans.2

About VIVITROL VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. Treatment with VIVITROL should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support. For more information, visit www.vivitrol.com.

INDICATIONS VIVITROL is indicated for:

Treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL. Patients should not be actively drinking at the time of initial VIVITROL administration. Prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support.

CONTRAINDICATIONS VIVITROL is contraindicated in patients:

Receiving opioid analgesics With current physiologic opioid dependence In acute opioid withdrawal Who have failed the naloxone challenge test or have a positive urine screen for opioids Who have exhibited hypersensitivity to naltrexone, polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG), carboxymethylcellulose, or any other components of the diluent

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose:

After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have a reduced tolerance to opioids. VIVITROL blocks the effects of exogenous opioids for approximately 28 days after administration. As the blockade wanes and eventually dissipates completely, use of previously tolerated doses of opioids could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc.). Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients who used opioids at the end of a dosing interval, after missing a scheduled dose, or after discontinuing treatment. Patients and caregivers should be told of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver, at the initial VIVITROL injection and with each subsequent injection. Strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Although VIVITROL is a potent antagonist with a prolonged pharmacological effect, the blockade produced by VIVITROL is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on their own, to overcome the blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids. Any attempt by a patient to overcome the VIVITROL blockade by taking opioids may lead to fatal overdose. Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade.

Injection Site Reactions:

VIVITROL must be prepared and administered by a healthcare provider. VIVITROL injections may be followed by pain, tenderness, induration, swelling, erythema, bruising, or pruritus; however, in some cases injection site reactions may be very severe. In the clinical trials, one patient developed an area of induration that continued to enlarge after 4 weeks, with subsequent development of necrotic tissue that required surgical excision. Injection site reactions not improving may require prompt medical attention, including, in some cases, surgical intervention. Inadvertent subcutaneous/adipose layer injection of VIVITROL may increase the likelihood of severe injection site reactions. Select proper needle size for patient body habitus, and use only the needles provided in the carton. Patients should be informed that any concerning injection site reactions should be brought to the attention of their healthcare provider.

Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal:

When withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by administrationof an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe. Some cases of withdrawal symptoms have been severe enough to require hospitalization, and in some cases, management in the ICU. To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting VIVITROL treatment:

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed. Patients should be made aware of the risk associated with precipitated withdrawal and be encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

Hepatotoxicity:

Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction have been observed in association with VIVITROL. Warn patients of the risk of hepatic injury; advise them to seek help if experiencing symptoms of acute hepatitis. Discontinue use of VIVITROL in patients who exhibit acute hepatitis symptoms.

Depression and Suicidality:

Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients taking VIVITROL should be monitored for depression or suicidal thoughts. Alert families and caregivers to monitor and report the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality.

When Reversal of VIVITROL Blockade Is Required for Pain Management:

For VIVITROL patients in emergency situations, suggestions for pain management include regional analgesia or use of non-opioid analgesics. If opioid therapy is required to reverse the VIVITROL blockade, patients should be closely monitored by trained personnel in a setting staffed and equipped for CPR.

Eosinophilic Pneumonia:

Patients who develop dyspnea and hypoxemia should seek medical attention immediately. Consider the possibility of eosinophilic pneumonia in patients who do not respond to antibiotics.

Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis:

Cases of urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis have been observed with the use of VIVITROL. Patients should be warned of the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention in a healthcare setting prepared to treat anaphylaxis. The patient should not receive any further treatment with VIVITROL.

Intramuscular Injections:

As with any intramuscular injection, VIVITROL should be administered with caution to patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.

Alcohol Withdrawal:

Use of VIVITROL does not eliminate nor diminish alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Interference with Laboratory Tests

VIVITROL may be cross-reactive with certain immunoassay methods for the detection of drugs of abuse (specifically opioids) in urine. For further information, reference to the specific immunoassay instructions is recommended.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The adverse events seen most frequently in association with VIVITROL therapy for alcohol dependence (ie, those occurring in ≥5% and at least twice as frequently with VIVITROL than placebo) include nausea, vomiting, injection site reactions (including induration, pruritus, nodules, and swelling), arthralgia, arthritis, or joint stiffness, muscle cramps, dizziness or syncope, somnolence or sedation, anorexia, decreased appetite or other appetite disorders. The adverse events seen most frequently in association with VIVITROL in opioid-dependent patients (ie, those occurring in ≥2% and at least twice as frequently with VIVITROL than placebo) were hepatic enzyme abnormalities, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, and toothache.
